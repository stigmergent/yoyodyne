// Which of the docket's entries the development manager is shown, in what
// order, and how the next pass resumes past what this one showed.
//
// The docket is a log, and on 2026-09-25 it held 187 entries, 125 of them on
// work items already closed and several of them repeats of one stopped run. The
// window a conversation carries was filled newest first by whatever was on the
// log, so it listed eleven entries nothing could act on while twelve stopped runs
// waited behind them for between seven and thirty-six days. A bounded window is
// not optional — a docket of hundreds delivered whole is the turn — so what is
// decided here is what the bound is spent on.
//
// Three things decide it. Only live entries are in it: the work item is not
// closed, and nobody has decided about the entry, or the decision has lapsed or
// the harness was stopped carrying it out. Each stopped run is in it once, however
// many entries it left. And it is a walk rather than a listing, exactly as the
// report pile is: the oldest stoppage first, anything critical ahead of it, and a
// durable position that the next pass resumes past, so an entry one pass could not
// show is the first thing the next pass shows.
