// Found is what the repository held of a stopped run's change when somebody
// looked: whether its branch and its worktree were there, and when that was
// asked. It is the one answer every surface that says what a stopped run
// preserved gives — the docket entry, the note on a released claim, `yoyo
// status`, and the hold the pull reads — so it is declared once, here, where the
// lowest of them can carry it.
//
// It exists because the run's own removal flags are not that answer. A flag is
// what a cleanup or a sweep remembered to write, and on 2026-09-23 run-838ffc48
// was read as having left no preserved change while its branch held the approved
// change at 8b06428b: the development manager crossed a cap on that reading and
// the re-run that followed was handed the wrong tip to start from. So what a
// surface says here it says from the repository, and says that it looked — or
// says it could not, and why, rather than falling back on the flags silently.
