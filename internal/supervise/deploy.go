package supervise

// Moving every part onto the build deployed over it.
//
// A part of the product is a process that stays up for days, and it runs the
// binary it was started from while builds land behind it. The watch session has
// long taken a deployed build up by itself, between runs; nothing did it for the
// Slack sink but the operator's maintenance script, which the supervisor now
// retires, and nothing did it for the dashboard at all — on 2026-09-26 it served
// a day and a half from a build without the section the operator was waiting
// for, until somebody restarted it by hand.
//
// So on its own poll the supervisor reads the revision of the binary on disk,
// asks each part which build it is running, and where the two differ moves the
// part onto the binary: one part at a time, and never while the part is in the
// middle of something a restart would cut short. A part that restarts itself —
// the watch, which drains its runs and re-executes in place — is left to do so,
// and the moment its lease is let go for the re-execution is read as that
// rather than as a death. Either way the move is recorded as a restart, apart
// from the failures the restart bound counts, so a day of deploys can never
// leave a part degraded.
