package supervise

// What the supervisor's periodic pass may ask of the supervisor.
//
// The pass (internal/maintain) is a resident: looked at on the supervisor's own
// poll, on the same goroutine as the looks at the children, so everything here
// reads and changes the supervisor's account of its children without a lock.
// It is narrow on purpose. The pass may read where a part stands, restart a
// part a program manager asked to have restarted — under the same bound and
// backoff a death is counted against — and ask the supervisor to take a
// deployed build up by re-executing into it. It may not start, stop, or kill
// anything any other way, and the scheduler is never stopped from here at all:
// stopping it cancels the runs it hosts, and it takes a deployed build up
// itself, between them.
