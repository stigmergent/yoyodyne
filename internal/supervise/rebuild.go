package supervise

// Rebuilding the product's own binary when its target branch lands.
//
// A harness developing itself runs from a binary built out of the checkout it
// is developing, so a landing is not running anywhere until somebody builds it.
// That somebody was the operator's maintenance launchd job, which ran
// `make build` whenever the target branch had moved past the binary — outside
// the product, and on its own clock, so every redeploy started from something
// the product did not know it had done. The supervisor now retires that job as
// it is installed (internal/maintenancejob), and this is the one duty of it the
// product still needs: the supervisor looks, on its own poll, at where the
// checkout's branch stands and at the revision the binary was built from, and
// builds when a landing touched what the binary is made of. What takes the
// build up is what already did: the watch re-executes itself into a replaced
// binary between runs (internal/redeploy).
//
// The bounce-when-idle step the job also had is deliberately not carried. It
// compared a process's start time with the binary's, which is wrong for a watch
// that re-executes itself in place and keeps its start time, and it killed the
// watch 32 times on 2026-09-26.
