// An item a role raised as unmeetable, as the conversations that answer it see
// it: the development manager deciding what becomes of the raising run's change,
// and the item's owner amending the item and releasing the raise's parking.
//
// yoyodyne-ifd.437.13 is what this is for. Its raise was answered with a repair
// the harness could never carry out, a re-run refused for want of a stopped run,
// and an escalation; and after its owner amended it and released the parking it
// still read blocked, because the status written while the raise stood was
// nobody's to clear.
