// The label half of admission: an item admitted under a labelling practice
// carries the label from the write that admits it, and work already in the
// queue acquires or loses one through an action of its own. Both doors matter
// for the reason both executor doors did — the practice that provoked this
// (a "reliability" label on every item admitted under the directive) was being
// followed by hand because the product manager held no action that sets one.
