// Compacting a provider session before it outgrows the request it is sent in.
//
// Every turn but the first resumes a provider session, and a resumed turn sends
// the whole of it: everything the session has been handed and everything it has
// said, again, with the new prompt on the end. So a session grows by every turn
// it takes, and the provider's request has a ceiling — 32 MB on the API these
// conversations are served from. The provider's own compaction triggers on its
// token threshold rather than on that ceiling, and compacting sends the whole
// conversation too, so by the time it tried on chat-419cedb4a013b063f477e322a2a60466
// the session was about 34 MB and could not be sent even to be made smaller.
//
// So the harness keeps its own measure of each session, in bytes, and compacts
// while the session still fits. The measure is what the harness itself put into
// the session and got back out of it — every prompt it sent and every reply it
// was given — which is less than what the provider's request carries: the
// provider adds its own framing, the JSON the request is encoded in escapes
// the text, and a reply's reasoning is kept in the session without ever reaching
// the harness. That is why the budget is a quarter of the ceiling rather than
// most of it. Provider-side inspection calls and results are also unmeasured
// when an adapter permits read-only tools. This budget is therefore a prompt
// and reply estimate, not a complete bound on the resumed provider session.
//
// A compaction is the rebuild a crossing makes, applied to the provider that is
// already holding the conversation: the turn is sent with no session to resume,
// and what the session was carrying comes from the harness's own record instead
// — the picture the conversation is working from and the most recent of what has
// been said, bounded by the rebuild's own budget. Nothing is sent to the old
// session to shrink it, so a compaction never needs the session to fit, and the
// provider's answer starts a new session the measure starts again from.
