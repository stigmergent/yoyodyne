// Correcting backlog state the records have made stale, and reporting the state
// that is held until somebody releases it instead.
//
// The product manager owns the queue, and three things in it stop describing the
// world without anybody having changed them: a status of blocked left over from
// a stoppage that ended, a dependency on work that closed, an attribution the
// goals no longer state. None of them is a decision anybody owes and every one
// of them used to wait for a person to notice, which is what this ends.
//
// It is deliberately not an update with a well-chosen argument. What the harness
// carries out here is not what the role says the item should say: it is a
// correction the records themselves have to support, judged against them at the
// moment of the act and refused where they still say the old state is right. So
// a repair asked for over a picture that has gone stale changes nothing, and an
// item somebody has to release is reported with its reason restated rather than
// touched.
