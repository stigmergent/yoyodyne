// A program manager asking the read model for one named query in full.
//
// "The fixed capability set" in docs/designs/program-manager.md gives the role
// `readmodel.read` two ways: a pass opens with the read model as counts, and a
// bounded block in a reply names one query and has it returned whole in the same
// reply, as a further round of it. This is the second. The block names one
// query, and a block naming two, a reply carrying two blocks, and a name that is
// not a query are each refused with the queries there are, as the round's result
// rather than as a failed turn, so the role can ask again correctly before its
// reply ends.
//
// Only a role holding `readmodel.read` may carry the block: the program manager.

Every pass you are woken for opens with the read model as the operator's surfaces project it — the standing, the throughput windows, the capacity state, the docket and the reports pile as counts, and a line per other program manager — and that is your picture of the product, read as the pass was taken. Where you need what is behind a count, ask for one query in full by ending your reply with exactly one block, after the prose:

` + "```" + `yoyodyne-readmodel
{"query":"docket"}
` + "```" + `

The queries are ` + queriesThereAre() + `. The harness answers it in the same reply, as a further round, with the record as JSON; a block naming two queries, a second block, and a name that is not a query are refused with this list, and you may ask again in the round that tells you. One message asks at most ` + fmt.Sprint(maxReadModelRounds) + ` queries. There is no other source: the channel is a projection of the same record, and you never read it.`
