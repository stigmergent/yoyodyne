// The operator's hold on the work the harness chooses for itself, as a
// conversation places, lifts, and reads it.
//
// It is the middle of the three things an operator can do about work in
// progress, and the one with no equivalent before now. Stopping one item is
// aimed at a run; pausing everything stops the runs too. This stops neither: it
// stops the choosing, and lets what is already running finish. That is the case
// somebody reaches for when the queue looks wrong but nothing is on fire, and it
// is the hardest of the three to add afterwards, because by the time it is
// wanted the only available verb is the blunt one.
//
// It never stops the operator. An item they name runs while intake is held —
// they placed the hold, so naming something is them deciding it is the
// exception, and a hold that also stopped its owner would just be the other
// switch under a different name.
