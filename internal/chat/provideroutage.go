// A turn the provider refused because nobody is logged into it or nobody can
// reach it, written down where somebody who is not at this terminal can read
// it.
//
// It is the usage-limit note's twin and differs in what it records: a limit is
// one refusal in a log the read model adds up, and an outage is one standing
// fact every surface names. So the record here is the product's outage, kept
// standing while turns keep meeting it and cleared by the first turn the
// provider serves — which is what makes re-authentication resume the line
// without anybody releasing anything. The turn itself fails exactly as it did
// before; what is new is that the failure names the wait and leaves the trace.
