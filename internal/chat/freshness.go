// How old a conversation's picture of the product is, and how it is made
// current without being thrown away.
//
// The product context is gathered once, when a conversation opens, and sent on
// its first turn only; every later turn resumes a provider session that already
// holds it. That is what keeps a long conversation affordable, and it is also
// how a conversation ends up describing a repository as it was hours ago. It
// happened twice on 2026-08-16, confidently both times, and nothing in the
// conversation said the picture was old — the mechanism was documented and the
// operator was expected to remember it.
//
// So the conversation says it itself. Freshness is a comparison rather than a
// timestamp: the picture records when it was taken and what commit the
// repository was on, and the repository and the tracker can say cheaply what
// they have done since. A refresh takes a new picture and hands it to the
// product manager as evidence, exactly as harness activity travels, so nothing
// it believes is silently replaced: it is told what moved and reconciles it in
// its next reply.
//
// Saying so turned out not to be enough. On 2026-09-18 the product manager
// advised the operator to add a section to CLAUDE.md that the file at HEAD had
// opened with for a month: its picture was roughly 500 landings old, the
// freshness line had said as much every time the conversation resumed, and the
// advice was built on the picture anyway. A line the operator has to act on is
// a line somebody eventually reads past. So the comparison is now the trigger
// as well as the statement: before every reply the harness measures how far
// the picture has fallen behind the target branch, in landings rather than
// hours, and past a configured threshold it re-reads the repository itself
// before the turn is answered. Where the re-read cannot be made — the tracker
// or the repository will not answer — the reply carries the age in its own
// text, so advice given over a stale picture is at least labelled as such. The
// threshold selects when; no setting turns either off.
