// The development manager stopping a run in flight.
//
// Until this existed, a run whose work she had decided was superseded — the one
// on yoyodyne-ifd.428.34 when yoyodyne-ifd.398 took its place — kept its
// developer slot and its review rounds until it ended on its own, because the
// only verb that could stop it was the operator's. A stop only a person can
// perform is a defect by the operator's rule of 2026-09-26, so the stop is a
// triage decision like the rest: recorded on the item's durable triage record
// with her reasoning, and carried out by the harness as it is recorded.
//
// Carrying it out is the operator's stop, made on her behalf. The harness writes
// the same request beside the run that `/stop` writes, naming her as the one who
// asked and the decision it carries out, and the run honors it at its next
// provider-call boundary exactly as it honors the operator's: it ends itself
// cancelled, its branch and worktree are left where they are, and its developer
// slot is free the moment its record is terminal. What differs is only what it
// leaves behind — the run's record and the item's notes say she stopped it and
// why, and the stoppage is docketed already settled by her decision rather than
// put back to her as a question.
//
// Nothing else can ask. The action is a triage decision, which only a role
// holding the triage capability may record, and the hand that writes the request
// is wired into the development manager's conversation and no other: a developer
// or a reviewer has no tracker actions at all, and a process outside her
// conversation has no way to name her as the one who asked.

// carryOutStop asks the run a stop names to stop, and records the decision.
//
// The run is asked about first, because a stop recorded against a run that has
// already ended would read as a decided stoppage the run never had.
//
// The request is written before the decision, which is the opposite of the order
// the other decisions keep, and for the reason that order exists: whichever write
// fails must leave the record saying no more than happened. A decision recorded
// and then not carried out would stand on the item's triage record against a run
// that goes on, and whatever stoppage that run later reached would read as
// already decided. Nor can it be taken back afterwards, because recording it
// supersedes whatever stood about the run before — a repair grant being
// re-entered, with the rounds it reserved released — and removing the stop would
// not put that back. The request does not have that problem in either
// direction: a request that could not be written leaves nothing recorded and the
// same decision can simply be recorded again, and a request that was written
// carries her decision to the docket by itself, so a decision the triage record
// then refused still reaches the stoppage as decided.
