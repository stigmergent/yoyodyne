// A change another role proposed to a document this conversation's role owns
// reaches it here.
//
// The proposal is addressed to an owner, and an owner that never hears it is a
// proposal that only ever reached the operator — which would make the owner's
// authority a formality and leave the operator arbitrating a design question
// alone. So the pending proposals for the kinds this role owns are carried into
// its turn as evidence: what was proposed, by whom, and why.
//
// It is evidence and nothing more. The product manager cannot decide one from
// here and cannot write to any document, so what it does with a proposal is
// what an owner does with an argument — say whether it is right, and why. The
// decision is recorded by the operator, and only that decision writes.
