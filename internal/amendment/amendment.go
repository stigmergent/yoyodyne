// Package amendment carries a proposed change to a canonical artifact from a
// role that does not own it to the role that does and to the operator.
//
// Ownership is an authorization boundary: a developer that finds the design
// wrong cannot edit the design, and a role with no way to say so either has
// only two moves left, both bad — implement against intent it believes is
// wrong, or edit the document anyway. This is the third: it says what should
// change and why, to the people who may decide it.
//
// A proposal is emphatically not a deferred edit. It carries no replacement
// prose, nothing in it is ever written into the artifact, and approving one
// changes no document: what an approval records is that the owner's authority
// was exercised in favour of the change, after which the owner makes it and the
// artifact's own revision log says the owner did. That is what keeps this from
// becoming the slow path by which a downstream role redefines upstream intent —
// the proposal is an argument, and the only thing it can produce on its own is
// a decision.
//
// The shape is the one the work-item proposal path already established, because
// the questions are the same: what is proposed, why, who decides, and what the
// record says afterwards. What it adds is an owner. A work item is proposed to
// the operator alone; a change to an artifact is proposed to the role that owns
// the artifact as well, because that role is the one whose intent is being
// argued with.

const Contract = `# Proposing a change to an artifact you do not own

The canonical documents — the brief, the goals and non-goals, the designs, the specifications, and the decision records — each belong to one role. If you are not that role you may not edit one, and you may not work around one you believe is wrong. What you can do is propose the change, which reaches the role that owns the document and the operator, and one of them decides.

A proposal is not an edit you have written in advance. Nothing in it is ever put into the document, an approved one is still made by the owner rather than applied for you, and your own work carries on unchanged either way — a proposal never blocks you and never waits. So propose the change you would argue for in a sentence, not the paragraph you would like the document to say: what should become true of it, and why.

To propose, end what you say with at most one block of this shape:

` + "```" + `yoyodyne-amendment
{"proposals":[{"artifact":"artifact-id","change":"what should become true of the document","why":"what makes the case for it"}]}
` + "```" + `

"artifact" is the id of an existing document — the file name of the artifact, without its extension. A proposal naming a document nobody records reaches nobody, because there is no owner to decide it. One block carries at most ` + maxProposalsPerReplyText + ` proposals, and each one takes an artifact, a change, and a reason and nothing else. If you are also reporting something, put this block before the report block, which is always last. Leave the block out entirely when you have nothing to propose, which is most of the time.

Writing the block is not the same as the proposal being recorded. The harness refuses one that names a document it has no record of, and one against a document you own yourself, and it can only tell you so after the reply that carried it: if it invokes you again, that turn opens with the refusal in its own words and you propose again from there — and if it does not, the refusal is on the run for the operator and you never hear it. So nothing you write may assert that a proposal has been raised: at the moment you write it you do not know, and a document, a comment, or a note claiming a proposal nobody is holding is a false record that outlives this work. Say what you propose in your reply, where it is read beside the block that carried it.`
