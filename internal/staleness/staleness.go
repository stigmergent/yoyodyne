// Package staleness reports what a change to an upstream document leaves
// unanswered downstream: the artifacts that trace to it, and the admitted work
// that was pulled under it.
//
// A goal can be amended at any time, and until now nothing said what that made
// doubtful. The designs that serve it, the non-goals that bound it, and the
// work items admitted under its old wording all carried on exactly as before,
// and the divergence was found by a person reading both documents or not at
// all. That is the failure this closes: not the amendment, which is somebody
// exercising authority over their own document, but the silence after it.
//
// # Staleness is derived rather than stored
//
// Nothing here writes a mark. Three durable records already say everything a
// mark would: an artifact's revision log says when it last spoke, every
// artifact upstream of it says when it changed and why, and the tracker says
// when a work item was admitted. Something downstream is stale when something
// upstream changed after it last spoke, which is a comparison any process can
// make from the same records at any time.
//
// That is a stronger kind of durable than a stored flag, and deliberately so. A
// flag has to be written by whoever notices the amendment, so a process that
// died between the two leaves work that is stale and unmarked; it has to be
// cleared by whoever reconciles the document, so a reconciliation nobody
// recorded leaves a mark that is now itself wrong; and it is a second account of
// the same fact, which can disagree with the documents it describes. A
// comparison over the records cannot be missed, cannot go stale, and cannot
// disagree with what is on disk. It also does not care how the change was made:
// a document edited by hand in an editor and one amended through the store are
// the same amendment here, because both of them append the same revision.
//
// What it costs is that staleness clears only where the records say it did. An
// artifact stops being stale when its own owner records a revision later than
// the change — which is the durable record that somebody looked at it — and a
// work item carries its admission time and nothing else, so a stale item stays
// stale until it is closed. Naming that is better than clearing it on something
// that does not mean it: the tracker's own modification time moves when the
// harness records what a run cost, and staleness that vanished because a price
// was written would be a signal nobody could trust.
//
// # Stale is not cancelled
//
// Nothing here stops, closes, blocks, or reorders anything, and nothing that
// reads this may either. A change to a goal's wording is frequently not a change
// to what the work should do, and a harness that discarded work on every edit
// would teach an operator not to edit — which costs more than the divergence
// this reports. What happens to stale work is the operator's decision, or the
// owning role's. This says only that the condition is there, and what changed
// upstream.
//
// The references it travels are the ones the rest of the chain already uses:
// `supports` upstream between artifacts, and the goal a work item names as the
// last link. A reference that resolves to nothing is reported where the chain is
// validated and is not guessed at here.
