package rolecapability_test

// The converted authorization sites, held against the decisions they made before
// they were converted.
//
// Every site below used to compare a role name — `role == owner`,
// `role == domain.RoleArchitect`, a hand-written list of tracker actions per role
// — and now asks the role-capability registry what the role holds. The claim the
// conversion rests on is that not one answer changed, and a claim like that is
// only worth anything written down as the answers themselves.
//
// So the tables here are the pre-conversion decision tables, transcribed from the
// literals the conversion removed rather than generated from the registry. A
// capability moved between bundles by accident fails here: the new answer and the
// old one disagree, and the old one is in this file where a reviewer can read it
// against the diff. Deriving these expectations from the registry instead would
// make the test agree with whatever the registry says, which is the one thing it
// must not do.
//
// It is an external test package because it reads the converted sites, and those
// packages read this one.

// grantedSinceTheConversion is the authority a ruling added after the table

// folded into it because the two say different things: the table is what the
// conversion had to preserve exactly, and this is what somebody decided to change
// afterwards and can be read as a list of such decisions.
//
// The product manager's `repair` corrects backlog state the records have made
// stale. It is the product-manager half of the operator's 2026-09-07
// broad-authority direction, recorded as a capability addition in the
// configurable-workflows design's authority-model section, and it is a widening
// of the role rather than drift in the conversion.
//
// The development manager's `brake` records what becomes of a hold the intake
// brake placed: release it, probe the line, or escalate it to the operator. It
// is the operator's 2026-09-19 decision that the brake summons her at once and
// waits on nobody unless she escalates it (yoyodyne-ifd.427), and it is the
// same authority as triage — deciding what becomes of work that stopped moving
// — one level up, held under the same capability.
//
// Both roles' `label` puts one of the tracker's own labels on an item or takes
// it off. It is the operator's 2026-09-19 admission practice under the
// reliability directive (yoyodyne-ifd.419) — a label on every item admitted
// under it — which the product manager could not follow without an action that
// sets one. A label is one of the item's own fields, so it is held under the
// same capability as updating the item, which is why the development manager
// has it too.
//
// The product manager's `inflight` hands the development manager her decision
// that an item whose run is in flight is superseded, narrowed, or to be retired.
// It is the operator's 2026-09-26 rule that a hand step routed to a person is a
// defect, applied to the relay the operator's assistant made by hand on
// 2026-09-27 (yoyodyne-ifd.428.40). It decides nothing about the run, which
// stays the development manager's, and is held under the same capability as
// retiring, which is admission run backwards.
//
// The product manager's `withdraw` takes back a proposal of her own that the
// operator has not decided. It is the same 2026-09-26 rule applied to proposal
// 959.1, which the duplicate guard's fallback put in front of the operator on
// 2026-09-28 for an admission her own authority covered, with nothing she held
// able to take it back (yoyodyne-ifd.433.18). It admits nothing and is held
// under the same capability as admitting.
