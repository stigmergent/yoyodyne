// The release-readiness sequence as the harness runs it: the checks registered
// as actions, the authority the gate holds, the definition that orders them, and
// the one call that walks it.
//
// Everything below the registry is deliberately thin. The definition decides the
// order and where each answer goes; this file decides nothing about the sequence
// and could not — an action it does not register cannot be selected, and an
// action requiring authority the grant does not confer is refused before an
// instance exists. That is the trade the workflow runtime makes, and this is the
// first place in the repository where a real sequence takes it.
