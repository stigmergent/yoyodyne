// TestOSProcessRunnerTimeoutTerminatesDescendantsHoldingPipes is the shell
// that backgrounds a child sharing its pipes and then waits on it. Killing the
// shell alone leaves that child holding the runner's stdout open, and the
// runner then drains until the child chooses to exit.
//
// Nothing here is a clock. The budget is spent when the shell says the child is
// holding the pipes, so the kill is asked of a tree that has the shape the test
// is about rather than of whatever a loaded machine had forked by then. And
// whether the kill reached the child is read off what it left behind: it holds
// the pipes for the whole of its sleep and writes its marker only afterwards,
// and Run cannot return until every holder of its pipes has closed them -- so a
// marker on disk when Run returns says the child ran to its own end with the
// pipes open, and no marker says the group kill reached it. The bound this used
// to keep, that Run came back inside two seconds, was a guess at how long a
// loaded machine takes to get here.
