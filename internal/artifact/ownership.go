package artifact

// Which role may write which artifact, in code rather than in a persona.
//
// The design states artifact ownership as an authorization boundary rather than
// a prompt convention, and the invariants already enforce it that way: the
// architect owns them, Authorize is what says so, and no mutation reaches the
// filesystem without going through it. This is the same boundary for the rest of
// the canonical documents, deliberately the same model rather than a second one
// beside it. Enforcement that lives only in a persona is enforcement a
// configuration can weaken, and a boundary that holds because a well-behaved
// model honoured it is not one anybody can rely on.
//
// The table it encodes is the one the design records, and it is now half a table:
// what stays here is which capability a kind of document belongs to, and who holds
// that capability is `internal/rolecapability`. The product manager owns the brief
// and the goals derived from it; the architect owns the designs and
// specifications, and the decision records with the invariants extracted from
// them. Both of those sentences are the registry's, read back through the two
// capabilities below rather than repeated here, because ownership stated twice is
// ownership two files can disagree about. The development manager owns no document
// at all — its decomposition is Beads work rather than Markdown — which falls out
// of the same lookup rather than being stated separately: no kind names a
// capability it holds, so it owns none.
//
// What this does not bound by itself is an agent with an editor in its worktree.
// Three things narrow it. Every mutation the harness performs comes through
// here; a revision log that records a change by a role which does not own the
// artifact is reported every time the set is loaded, so a hand-edited claim of
// somebody else's authority is a named problem rather than something only a
// reader would notice; and a developer's diff is gated on the paths these
// documents live in before it reaches a reviewer, so an edit made with an editor
// is refused and handed back unless the work item granted the path
// (internal/protectedpath). That gate is about the file rather than the
// document, which is why it does not replace this: it refuses the edit whether
// or not the editor also touched the revision log, and it says nothing about who
// may amend what.
//
// That report is deliberately not a refusal, and the difference matters most for
// a revision recorded before this rule existed. The revision log is append-only:
// the only way to make a past entry lawful is to rewrite history, which is the
// one thing the log exists to prevent. So a document with such an entry keeps
// loading, keeps governing what is downstream of it, and stays amendable by its
// owner — and the entry keeps being reported until somebody decides what to do
// about it. Refusing instead would drop the document out of the set, cascade
// into the orphan and dangling-reference reports for everything that referred to
// it, and leave a document that could neither load nor be lawfully corrected.
