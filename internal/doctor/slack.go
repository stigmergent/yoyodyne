package doctor

// Diagnosing the reporting sink, which is the part of an installation that is
// wrong most quietly.
//
// Everything else here fails loudly: an unauthenticated provider refuses an
// invocation, an uninitialized tracker refuses a claim. A sink fails by saying
// nothing, and a channel that says nothing is indistinguishable from a harness
// with nothing to report. So the questions asked here go past "is it running":
//
//   - Are this project's own secrets stored, under the namespaced names, rather
//     than some Slack token being present somewhere on the machine? Several
//     harnesses on one machine is the ordinary case, and under the old generic
//     names every one of them passes a check the way the wrong one would.
//   - Is a sink actually holding this product's lease, or is there only the
//     record of one that died?
//   - Is the sink that is running this build? A sink installed months ago posts
//     the milestones that build knew about and drops every one added since,
//     which reads in the channel as a quiet week.
//   - Is it running with this project's secrets, rather than with whatever the
//     shell it was started from happened to have exported?
//
// None of those is answerable from the lease, which is why the sink writes down
// what it is and this reads it back.
//
// Nothing in this file ever reaches StatusProblem, and that is a rule rather
// than an accident of the cases that happen to be here. A problem is what stops
// work running, and reporting is an observation and never a gate: a sink that
// was never started, a workspace that is down, a token nobody stored — none of
// them changes anything about any run, so an operator with all three still has
// an installation that works and an exit status that says so. Reported as
// problems, these would make `yoyo doctor` fail on a healthy machine, and the
// first thing anybody gating on it would do is stop gating on it.
//
// What they are instead is the whole reason this file is long. A warning here is
// not a small problem; it is the class of failure that produces silence rather
// than an error, which is why each one is named exactly and carries the command
// that ends it.
