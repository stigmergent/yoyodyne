// Whether every running part of the product can read the configuration as it
// stands now.
//
// The configuration finding above says this build reads the file. A part of
// the product started days ago runs the build it was started from, and a key
// a landing added since is one that build refuses: on 2026-09-28 the dashboard
// served nothing but the decoder's error for two hours after the effort lines
// landed, while the watch and the installed binary had been checked and read
// the file fine. Each long-running part records, as it starts, the keys its
// build reads; this compares the file against every part still running and
// names the part, its build, and the keys.
//
// The scheduler is the one part here that would stop work: a watch that
// cannot read the configuration chooses nothing. So a mismatch on it is a
// problem, and one on any other part is a warning, for the reason every
// service finding is — a sink that cannot read the file reports nothing and a
// dashboard serves an error, and no run is stopped by either.
