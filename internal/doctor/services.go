// Whether each part the product declares could actually start.
//
// The services section says which parts of the product run together, and the
// configuration refuses what it can check from the file alone: a Slack service
// over reporting that is off, a dashboard bound outside loopback with a
// generated token. What it cannot check is whether the thing a service needs
// from outside the file is there — the two Slack tokens in the keychain, the
// dashboard's supplied token in the store the section names — and that is what
// is asked here, one finding per service, so an operator who enabled a part
// reads whether starting the product would start it or start it into a refusal.
//
// Every finding here is a warning and never a problem, for the reason every
// Slack finding is: a part that cannot start reports nothing or serves nothing,
// and no run is stopped by it. The remedy on each is the command that stores
// what is missing.
