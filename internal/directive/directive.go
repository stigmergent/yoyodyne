// Package directive is what the operator told an agent to do, recorded where
// every agent has to meet it.
//
// The design has said from the beginning that a directive applies regardless of
// which agent received it, that it stays discoverable until it is superseded or
// retired, and that one which changes a governed artifact or which nobody can
// act on unambiguously pauses the work it affects until the operator settles it.
// What existed was only the first half of the first sentence: direction could be
// written down beside one work item, and a directive that changed what an
// in-flight item was supposed to be reached nothing. The work carried on against
// the intent it was given.
//
// A directive that is durably recorded and enforces nothing is the failure this
// package exists to end, so a record here carries the two things enforcement
// needs and nothing decorative: what work it affects, and what is unresolved
// about it. The run pipeline reads both — before it starts a run, before it
// resumes one, and before it puts a change through the gate — and a directive
// that pauses work is why a run stops short of finishing rather than something
// noted after it finished anyway.
//
// Nothing here is attached to whoever received the directive. The receiving role
// is recorded, because "the reviewer was told this" is worth knowing, but it is
// an attribute of the record rather than where the record lives: a directive
// kept inside the conversation that heard it, or inside the run that was told
// it, would reach exactly that conversation or that run.
