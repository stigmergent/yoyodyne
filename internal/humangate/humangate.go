// Package humangate is a step machinery cannot take: something a named person
// has to do, and record having done, before the work behind it proceeds.
//
// It exists because the tracker cannot say it. A work item can depend on another
// item, and that is the whole of what a dependency means — so a condition that
// really reads "a person has to sign this off first" has only one encoding
// available to it, which is an item somebody has to close. Closing an item is
// something machinery does. On 2026-09-04 that is exactly what happened: the
// declarative executor's parity soak reserved the operator's own reading of the
// soak before the default flipped, the reservation was written into an item's
// text, the item was closed by the run that finished the work in it, and the
// flip's gate read satisfied. Nobody decided to skip the operator's step; the
// encoding had no way to hold it.
//
// A gate here is that missing shape. It is declared on the work it holds — a
// work item, or a state in a workflow definition — and the only thing that ever
// passes it is a durable record of a person's act, written by a person at the
// command line. Nothing derives one, no closure implies one, and no action a
// workflow can select writes one: `internal/runstate` holds the record and
// `yoyo gate record` is the one door into it. So a gate that nobody has
// discharged holds forever, which is the point — the failure it replaces is a
// gate that quietly stopped holding.
//
// # Declared, never inferred
//
// A gate is only ever what an author wrote after the marker. Nothing is read out
// of prose, and the asymmetry that makes `internal/surface` infer is the
// opposite one here: a conflict surface missed costs a race the harness already
// handles, while a gate invented from a sentence stops work until somebody
// notices they have to type a command about a gate nobody meant to declare. So
// the marker is the whole of it, and a malformed declaration is a refusal rather
// than a gate quietly dropped — a dropped gate is the original failure again,
// with the harness's own parser as the thing that skipped the person's step.
//
// The fields read are the ones somebody authored. The notes are not among them,
// for the reason a protected-path grant is not read from them either: the
// harness appends each run's own record there, so a summary that discussed a
// gate would declare one on the item after the fact, from a run rather than from
// the person whose gate it is.
