// Development is parallel and integration is serial. Two runs may develop,
// check, and review at the same time, but at most one may promote into a given
// target branch, because a promotion reads where that branch is and then moves
// it. Two of them interleaved is a race every concurrent run can lose; the lease
// below turns it into a queue, so isolated work still lands automatically when
// two runs finish together.
//
// The lease is a sibling of the reservation lock and works the same way: an
// advisory file lock the operating system drops when its holder exits. A
// promotion whose process died therefore leaves no stale lock for anybody to
// clear, and the half-finished promotion behind it is settled by reconciliation
// rather than by the next run to reach the queue.
//
// It is taken by the promoting run's own harness, in that process, and by
// nothing else. No agent has a path to it for the same reason no agent has a
// path to a merge: the roles that authorize a promotion must not be able to
// perform one.
