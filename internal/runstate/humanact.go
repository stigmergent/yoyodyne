package runstate

// A person's recorded act, and the only thing that ever passes a human gate.
//
// Everything else the harness keeps is a record of something the harness did.
// This is the one record of something it cannot do: a named person saying they
// took a step, written by them at the command line. It exists because the
// alternative encoding — an item somebody closes — is one machinery can satisfy,
// and did, which is how a parity soak the operator had reserved for themselves
// was passed by a run closing the item that reserved it.
//
// An act is recorded against the thing that declared the gate — the work item,
// or the workflow instance — and it passes that gate there and nowhere else.
//
// The subject is the whole of what keeps a gate name honest. A name is a word
// somebody chose, and the useful words recur: `release-signed` and
// `soak-reviewed` describe a step taken once per release and once per soak, not
// once ever. If the name alone were the identity, the first recorded act would
// pass every later declaration of that word — the next release's sign-off would
// read satisfied with nobody having signed anything, and the operator could not
// even record the new act, because the gate would already be passed. That is the
// failure this whole mechanism exists to end, arriving through the namespace
// instead of through the tracker.
//
// It is what keeps the workflow half honest too, and more sharply: a definition
// gates a state by name, and every instance of that definition reaches the same
// state. One act against the name would pass that gate for every run the harness
// ever makes afterwards. Against the instance, each run's own step is its own.
//
// The reader already holds this rule inside one item's text — a name declared
// twice saying two different things is unreadable, because one act would pass
// both. The subject is that same rule across time and across work.
//
// Recording is exclusive per subject and gate. An act already recorded there is
// refused rather than overwritten: the first act is the one that passed it, and
// a second write would replace whose signature is on it with whoever typed last.
// A different subject is a different gate to pass, so it is not a second write.
//
// Nothing in the pipeline writes one. No registered action produces one, no
// closure implies one, and the store offers no verb that derives one — which is
// what "satisfiable only by a recorded human act" amounts to once it is code
// rather than a rule somebody remembers. `internal/cli` is the door, and a
// conformance test holds the store to having only that one.
