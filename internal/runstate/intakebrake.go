// The brake's own account of the hold it placed, and what it does next.
//
// A hold the operator places waits on the operator, which is the whole point
// of the switch. A hold the harness's own failure-storm brake places used to
// wait on a person too, and that is the stall this record ends: the brake
// tripped on 2026-09-02, 09-05, 09-13, 09-17, and 09-19, and every time the
// line sat held until somebody noticed — on the last of them for about two
// hours, with a free developer slot idle. The operator's decision, recorded as a
// directive the same day, was that the brake may trip so long as the
// development manager is always invoked at once to sort it out and nothing
// waits.
//
// So a brake hold carries this. It names the runs that tripped it, so the
// development manager is shown what blocked and why rather than told that
// something did. It records that she was summoned, what she decided, and when a
// probe starts by itself if she has not — because a hold that waits on a turn
// nobody can take is the same stall one layer over. And it records the probe:
// one run started under the hold, whose landing reopens intake and whose
// blocking keeps it held and puts the question to her again. A brake hold comes
// to wait on a person two ways, both recorded here as such: her deciding that it
// should — an escalation to the operator — or the harness deciding it after a
// bounded number of those summons-and-probe cycles have gone round without her
// escalating. The bound is what keeps "nothing waits" from becoming a loop that
// spends one of her turns and one probe run every cooldown on a broken machine
// for as long as nobody happens to look.
//
// The record is on the hold rather than beside it because every surface that
// says intake is held reads the hold, and what those surfaces were missing was
// exactly this: who is deciding, and what happens if nobody does.
