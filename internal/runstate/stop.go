package runstate

// The operator's request that one run stop.
//
// Cancelling a run this process started is a context away, and that is all
// stopping ever needed while the operator started every run themselves. It is
// not enough once work runs without them: the run they want stopped is usually
// in another process, and this one has no handle on it. Killing that process is
// the verb they would otherwise be left with, and it is the wrong one — it
// leaves a claimed item, a worktree, and a branch that nothing accounts for.
//
// So a stop is asked for rather than performed. It is written beside the run,
// for the reason a released wait is: the process working on the run holds that
// run's state under a lease and is the only thing entitled to write it, so the
// operator states the fact in a file of their own and the run reads it. The run
// honors it at its next provider-call boundary, exactly where it reads the
// operator's hold, and ends itself the way a cancelled run ends — terminal,
// artifacts preserved, the item noted — so what it leaves behind is settled by
// the same reconciliation that settles everything else.
//
// The development manager asks for a stop too, through the same file. A run
// whose work she has decided is superseded, narrowed, or mis-launched is one she
// records a "stop" triage decision about, and the harness writes the request
// on her behalf with who asked and the decision it carries out beside the
// reason. The run cannot tell the two apart and does not need to: it stops the
// same way, and only the words it ends on and the docket entry it leaves differ.
//
// What it deliberately cannot do is interrupt a provider invocation already
// streaming. That generation is already paid for, and throwing it away would
// leave the run needing the same work again, which is the cost that made killing
// processes the wrong verb in the first place. A stop therefore takes effect at
// the next boundary rather than instantly, and whoever asked for it is told that
// it has not landed yet rather than told it has.
