// A queued merge's checks, as the forge last reported them.
//
// A merge the forge queued is waiting on the base branch's requirements, and
// until yoyodyne-ifd.429.16 the record said only that it was queued. Pull
// request 609 sat queued for 33 hours against a red build that way, and 713 sat
// 31 commits behind main failing two tests its change never touched, while the
// development manager waited on it because the record said the merge was
// queued. What the record was missing is the thing that decides whether a
// queued merge is ever going to land: its checks. The reconciling sweep reads
// them on every pass and writes them here, so every surface that says a merge
// is queued says what its checks are beside it.
