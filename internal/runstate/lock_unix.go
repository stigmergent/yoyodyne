// meant to avoid. On every platform this file builds for the descriptor is
// deallocated even when close reports EINTR, so an interrupted close leaves
// nothing a caller can act on — and because the lock is dropped before the close
// is attempted, it leaves nothing held either. Reporting it would be reporting a
