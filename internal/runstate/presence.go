// Whether a process can be found behind a run in flight.
//
// A run's record says "running" from the moment it is reserved until something
// writes its ending, and a process that dies writes nothing. So the status field
// is a claim the process made about itself, and the one question every reader
// of an in-flight run actually has — is anything working on it — is not in the
// record at all. The lease answers it for whoever takes the lease, which is how
// the sweep and the claim audit have always decided; but a surface that only
// reads must not take it, because for the instant it lasts a reading is a second
// owner, and a process adopting the run in that instant would be refused.
//
// So a process that takes a run's lease writes down which process it is beside
// the lease, exactly as a conversation's holder does, and a reader checks the
// process it names rather than taking anything. That is what lets `yoyo status`
// and the dashboard say a run has no process behind it rather than printing it
// as running: on 2026-09-26 run-3b94404c read as running, in developer slot 1,
// for twenty hours after its process exited
// (docs/diagnoses/yoyodyne-ifd-428-49-dead-run-held-its-slot.md).
