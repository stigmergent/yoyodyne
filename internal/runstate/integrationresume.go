// An approved change the environment stopped on its way to the target branch,
// and what resuming it costs the item: nothing.
//
// A run's budgets bound the work's own failures, and a stop between the
// reviewer's approval and the promotion is not one. yoyodyne-ifd.309's rerun
// passed independent review and then stopped at integration twice — once for an
// uncommitted edit in the primary checkout, once for a tracker read that timed
// out under load — and every verb that could have picked it up spent something:
// a repair grant for a run that recorded no findings, or a fresh run and a fresh
// review for a change nobody disputed. Four operator overrides were signed to
// get one approved change onto the target, none of them for a verdict.
//
// So the stop is a durable fact on the run, written where the run fails from
// the error that ended it — a dirty checkout by its sentinel, a replay the
// harness killed by its own, a transport that did not answer by the recovery
// package's closed reading of the error — and a
// resumption is a continuation rather than an attempt: the run is made live
// again at the promotion it stopped short of, with the approval it already had,
// and the item's counters stay where the review left them. What leaves that path is a replay that conflicts, which is a
// person's to settle exactly as it always was.
