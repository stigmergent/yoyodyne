// moment it stopped. It is the one field a reader can answer "what stopped this"
// from without inferring it, and inferring it is what went wrong before it
// existed: a check failure, a refused path, and a reviewer's findings are all
// evidence a run carries while it is still repairing, so every one of them can be
// on the record of a run the provider killed, and a reader who took the first of
// them it found as the reason read that run as a failed change.
//
// It is written where the run is stopped and by nothing that reads the record
// afterwards. A record written before the field existed carries none, and a
// reader says it names none rather than guessing one.
