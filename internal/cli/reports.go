// Reading what agents reported, without opening a conversation.
//
// A report is how something an agent noticed while its own work succeeded
// reaches the operator, and until this verb existed the only way to read the
// pile was `/reports` inside `yoyo chat`. That fails the operator the channel
// exists for: a run that finishes overnight tells them a report was filed, and
// reading it costs them an interactive conversation with a provider behind it.
// It also puts the pile out of reach of anything scripted, which is the surface
// a channel meant to be triaged eventually needs.
//
// So this reads the same durable store the conversation reads and nothing else.
// It is read-only: a report is written once and never revised, and nothing here
// retires one, handles one, or decides anything about the pile. What it does
// show is what somebody else decided — the product manager records what became
// of a report beside the pile, and a listing that could not tell a report
// somebody dealt with from one nobody has read would send an operator looking
// for work that is already done.

What agents reported without it stopping their work: a risk one worked around,
an assumption that may not hold, a defect or a stale document outside the work
it was given, something in its environment that stopped it verifying what it
wanted to. Every role files them the same way and they land in one pile per
product, which is what this reads.

Each report names itself, the role and the configured agent that made it, the run
or conversation it came from, the work item where there was one, a severity —
critical, warning, or note — and the text.

Beside the run it names the harness build that run executed, and how many changes
the target branch has taken since. A report is a claim about that build, so a
report from a build behind the tip may describe something already fixed. Check
before admitting work from it. A report filed before reports carried a build says
"no build recorded", and a build the product's repository does not hold is named
as not counted. A report the Lead Product Manager has
decided about carries what it decided, under it; everything else is still
waiting on somebody. The whole pile is printed, oldest first; `+"`/reports`"+` in
`+"`yoyo chat`"+` shows the same reports beside the conversation, listing the
twenty most recent.

A report filed at `+"`critical`"+` or `+"`warning`"+` is marked at the left margin, with
`+"`!!`"+` and `+"`!`"+`, and coloured where the terminal permits colour — so a pile can be
scanned for what is already costing somebody without every line being read. The
marker is the part that survives: a listing piped to a file, read where
`+"`NO_COLOR`"+` is set, or shown on a terminal that says it is dumb still says which
reports are which. `+"`--json`"+` carries none of it and is unchanged.

The listing leads with how the pile stands: how many of the collected reports
nobody has decided about, how long ago the oldest of those was filed, and the
worst severity among them. That is the line to read over a week rather than
once — a pile being worked through has a falling count and a falling oldest age,
and a pile nothing is draining looks identical to it in any single reading.

A report decides nothing and nothing waits on it, so this is read-only: it
retires nothing, handles nothing, and changes no work. Deciding what becomes of
a report is the Lead Product Manager's, in a conversation, and the unhandled
ones are carried into that conversation without anybody having to fetch them,
oldest first with anything critical ahead of them, resuming where the last turn
stopped.
