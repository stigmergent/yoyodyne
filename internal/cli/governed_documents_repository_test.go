// The tests here load this repository's own governed documents — the brief and
// goals under the specifications home, the designs, the decision records, and
// the invariants — with the loaders the harness uses, through the homes the
// configuration names. Every other artifact and invariant test builds a
// synthetic store in a temporary directory, so a change to a loader or to what
// Validate accepts could refuse every document this repository ships without a
// single check failing: the refusal would first surface when a run or a
// conversation loaded them.
//
// This is the complement of what goals_repository_test.go holds rather than a
// return of what yoyodyne-ifd.326 took off the build. What fails here is a file
// the loader will not read at all, which is the harness disagreeing with the
// documents it governs and is fixed in whichever of the two changed. What the
// documents say about each other — a link upstream that does not hold, a
// revision recorded under a role that does not own the document — is logged
// rather than failed, for 326's reason: it is how somebody wrote a document they
// own, and `yoyo artifact list` reports it in front of them.
