// decision was written down, and the two would disagree the first time somebody
// changed their mind.

An operator brings the Lead Product Manager an idea rather than a work item —
"what if we did X", "is Y worth it" — and what it makes of one is written down
here: the recommendation, how the idea sits against the brief and the goals,
what the evidence states and where that came from, what was inferred rather than
read, what is still uncertain, what argues the other way, and the reasoning.

Everything here is advice. Recording an evaluation admitted no work, changed no
document, and approved nothing, and nothing in these commands does either. What
became of the advice is elsewhere and has its own record: work in the backlog,
which reached it through the approval your project asks for, and a change to a
document, which reached it through that document's owner and `+"`yoyo amendment`"+`.

Each evaluation also keeps what the harness actually retrieved for it and when,
beside the sources the Lead Product Manager cited. The two are different claims
and they are kept apart on purpose: one is what it says it read, the other is
what was fetched.
