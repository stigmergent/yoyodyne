// Letting the harness choose work again, from where the operator is standing.
//
// Holding intake has always had two placers — the conversation's `/hold`, and
// the failure-storm brake, which places the operator's own switch when runs keep
// blocking — but until this verb existed it had one lifter, `/release`, inside a
// product-manager conversation. So an operator at a terminal met a hold the
// harness placed overnight, was told what had stopped, and was told a remedy
// they could not run from where they were reading it. An override that only
// exists behind a door you have to remember is not an override.
//
// This is that remedy as a command. It is the same switch the conversation lifts
// — one record under the product, read by every path that would start work the
// operator did not name — so lifting it here lifts it for both. Which surface
// lifted it is recorded beside the absence, because a brake the operator was
// told about is a hold the channel owes him the ending of, by name.
//
// It is deliberately only the lifting half. Placing a hold is a decision with a
// reason attached, and the conversation is where that reason belongs; recovery
// is what has to work with no conversation open.

Let the harness choose work from this product's backlog again, after intake was
held -- by you in a conversation, or by the failure-storm brake when runs kept
blocking with nothing landing between them. It is the terminal half of the
conversation's `+"`/release`"+`: one record under the product, so whichever
surface lifts it, the hold is gone for both.

A hold the brake placed does not need this. The brake summons the development
manager the moment it trips and releases the hold on her decision, or on a
probe run that lands once the configured cooldown has passed with no decision
recorded. A brake hold waits on a person only once it is escalated to you: by
her, or by the harness itself after execution.brake_escalation_cycles of those
summons-and-probe cycles have gone round with her not escalating it. This
lifts it sooner, and says what the harness was in the middle of.

Nothing else changes. Runs already going were never stopped by the hold, an item
you named with `+"`yoyo run`"+` was never subject to it, and releasing what is
not held is not an error -- you mean the harness to be choosing work, and it is.

A watching `+"`yoyo work`"+` session brakes rather than exits while intake is
held, so it starts choosing again at its next poll. A session that has already
ended is started again with `+"`yoyo work`"+`.

Holding intake is not here: it is a decision with a reason worth recording, and
`+"`/hold`"+` in `+"`yoyo chat`"+` is where that is said. This verb is the
recovery path that works with no conversation open.

This is a person's verb. A process the harness launched for a role -- an
agent's shell, marked by YOYODYNE_AGENT_ROLE -- is refused it and told so.

Options:
  --config <path>   configuration file (default: the nearest .yoyodyne/config.yaml)
  --json            emit machine-readable JSON`)
