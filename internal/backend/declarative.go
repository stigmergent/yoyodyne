// A dialect delivered as data.
//
// This is the answer to how a user-supplied provider plugin arrives, and the
// trade it makes is stated in docs/provider-plugins.md rather than left to be
// inferred. What it buys: a plugin that is data cannot decide anything. There is
// no field here in which to write a duration, a retry count, or a budget, and
// nothing on the other side of this file runs, so the property the design
// demands -- a plugin describes what a provider said and never decides whether
// or how long to wait -- is structural rather than asked for. It also needs no
// fork, no vendoring, and no rebuild of the harness. What it costs: it covers a
// provider whose reports differ from another's in spelling, and covers nothing
// else. A provider whose dialect needs code is a built-in.
//
// Rules are ordered and the first match wins, which is what lets a narrower
// reading stand in front of a broader one -- a limit already being served under
// an overage allowance ahead of the same event read as a limit refusing work.
