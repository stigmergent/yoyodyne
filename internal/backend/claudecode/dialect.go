// Claude Code's operational dialect: how this provider says it is throttled, how
// it says it is exhausted, how to tell those apart, and when to come back.
//
// All of it used to be spread through the parser, which is what made it look
// general when it never was. It is one implementation of the provider contract
// in internal/backend now, and nothing above it special-cases this provider: the
// parser hands the dialect an event, the dialect answers with one of the
// contract's answers, and the harness decides what waiting -- if any -- that
// answer earns. The dialect states no duration anywhere, which is the property
// that keeps a provider from being able to spend an account.

// one such thing — the model — so a not-found here is a selector this provider
// will not serve rather than a missing endpoint or a bad path.
//
// Provenance, stated because it is weaker than the overload's. No recorded run
// carries one: a model this account cannot reach has never been asked for, since
// every configured selector until now has been a family alias the provider
// always resolves. What it is read from instead is the API's own not-found
// answer, whose body names the model — `{"type":"error","error":{"type":
// "not_found_error","message":"model: …"}}` — and which the CLI puts on its
// terminal API-error message the same way it puts the overload's.
//
// The match is narrow in both halves for that reason: the status has to be the
// not-found one and the message has to name a model. A message this version does
// not recognize is left where it was — a refusal that stands, failing the turn
// exactly as it does today — rather than becoming a silent move to another
// model. The first real occurrence recorded is the evidence that should replace
// this comment.
//
// What this cannot reach is a CLI that refuses the selector before it calls the
// API at all. That ends the process without a terminal envelope, so the only
// place the refusal could be read is the process's plain output — which this
// dialect is now handed, but reads only for the two refusals below that a
// person or the network ends. A pinned version rejected up front therefore
// still fails the turn rather than falling back; the case for reading it off
// plain output is a recorded occurrence.
const notFoundStatus = "404"

// notAuthenticated is this provider saying it will not accept the account the

//
// It is the one place the leftovers below are deliberately narrowed, so the
// reason is worth stating. The trade those leftovers make — being wrong about a
// transient death costs one more invocation, being wrong about a refusal that
// stands costs the whole run — holds for weather and not for this: relaunching
// into an account the provider will not accept spends a run's whole relaunch
// budget on an answer that cannot change, and no attempt of it is any different
// from the first. What it is read as is the contract's own answer for a login
// nobody has renewed, which the harness waits out spending nothing rather than
// failing the run over; the status form is matched here as well so that one
// provider reporting one condition two ways earns one answer.
//
// It is read off a terminal API error, like every other match here, and off
// the process's plain output — stderr, or stdout where what it wrote there was
// not an envelope — when the stream ended without a terminal at all. An agent's
// own prose about being logged out is left where it was either way: what the
// provider said about the request is on that envelope or in that plain output
// and nowhere else.
//
// The words are the CLI's own. Claude Code 2.1.276 titles the refusals it
// makes over an account it will not accept "Not logged in", "Login expired",
// "OAuth token revoked", "Invalid API key", and "Invalid auth token", and pairs
// the ones a login fixes with "Please run /login". One recorded shape: a home
// nobody has logged into, asked on 2026-09-19 with `-p --output-format
// stream-json`, ends on a terminal envelope with terminal_reason "api_error"
// and the result text "Not logged in · Please run /login", is_error true,
// subtype "success", and nothing on stderr. The remedy is the same whichever
// title it arrives under, which is why one answer covers them all.

//
// It is narrower than the leftovers on purpose, and the reason is the reverse of
// the not-authenticated one above. A connection that dropped mid-reply reached
// the provider and may well not drop again, so relaunching it is right; nothing
// reaching the provider at all is not answered by asking twice more against a
// budget and then blocking, which is what happened to at least two runs in the
// 2026-09-15..18 outage. What it is read as is a wait that spends nothing, so a
// message this version does not recognize keeps failing over into the relaunch
// path rather than into a wait nobody can justify.

//
//	API Error: 529 Overloaded. This is a server-side issue, usually temporary —
//	try again in a moment. If it persists, check https://status.claude.com.
//
// Both had already exhausted the CLI's own ten api_retry attempts on the same
// condition, so a terminal result in this shape is what the provider says after
// it has finished retrying rather than instead of retrying.

// rateLimitInfo names the fields of a rate_limit_event this dialect acts on. The
// provider sends more than this — utilization, overage accounting, the reason
// overage is unavailable — and all of it is preserved in the event stream; only
// these decide whether a run waits.
//
// Provenance of these names. No recorded rate_limit_event was available to read
// them off: this parser used to route the event to its default branch, so all
// twenty entries in the local run history had already had their payload
// discarded, and a hard limit could not be provoked on demand to record a fresh
// one. They were therefore read out of the shipped provider CLI itself —
// Claude Code 2.1.224, the emitted-message schema `$1v` and the payload schema
// it references, `L1v` — which declares:
//
//	type:           "rate_limit_event"
//	rate_limit_info: status ∈ {allowed, allowed_warning, rejected}   (required)
//	                 resetsAt?: int

//
// resetTime reads resetsAt as whole Unix seconds because that CLI compares it as
// `resetsAt * 1000 <= Date.now()` and renders it as `resetsAt - Date.now()/1000`.
// exhausted excludes isUsingOverage because that CLI shows a hard limit only
// when overage is not already serving the request.
//
// That is a description of the provider, not a promise from it. Everything here

// rather than starts waiting wrongly. The first real exhausted limit this
