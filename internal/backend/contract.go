// The provider contract: what the harness needs a provider to say, in terms no
// one provider owns.
//
// Everything the harness knew about rate limits, retries, and when to try again
// used to be Claude Code's dialect, sitting in the adapter that speaks it. The
// envelope names, the field spellings, the unit a reset time arrives in, which
// terminal error is weather and which is a refusal that stands -- none of that
// is general, and all of it decides whether a run waits and for how long. A
// second provider inherits none of it, and a user who wants to reach a harness
// nobody here has seen inherits less.
//
// So the contract is the answers rather than a way to reach in and parse.
// Whatever a provider said, in whatever shape it said it, what the harness needs
// from a dialect is which of nine things happened, and -- for the one answer
// where it makes sense -- when the provider said the condition lifts. A dialect
// describes; it never decides. There is deliberately no duration anywhere in
// what a dialect returns: how long to wait, whether to wait at all, and against
// which budget are the harness's, because that is what the operator's
// usage_limit settings and a run's safety properties rest on. A plugin that
// could decide to keep waiting could spend an account.
//
// The two cases already learned the hard way are named here rather than left for
// each dialect to rediscover: a limit that names no reset time is unknown rather
// than fatal, and a reset time that is not in the future is malformed and must
// not be trusted. ReadReset is the single place either is decided.
//
// See docs/provider-plugins.md for how a dialect is delivered and what a
// user-supplied one may and may not do.

// Answer is what a provider said about one attempt, in the only terms the
// harness acts on. The set is closed on purpose: a dialect that cannot say which
// of these happened is describing something the harness has no response to, and
// saying nothing is the honest answer for that rather than inventing a tenth.
//
// It grows only when the harness gains a response, which is what admitted the
// seventh: a pinned model version needs a refusal it can answer by asking for a
// different selector, and none of the other six is that. The eighth and ninth
// were admitted together for the response they share: a provider nobody is
// logged into, or nobody can reach, is a wait that spends nothing — no relaunch,
// no repair attempt, no blocker — and ends when the provider answers again,
// which none of the seven before them is. An answer nothing does anything
// differently about does not belong here — it is evidence, and the event log
// already keeps it.
