// The vocabulary below is Codex's own non-interactive event protocol: each line
// is an envelope carrying an event under `msg`, and the event names itself with
// a `type`. No recorded Codex stream existed in this repository when this was
// written, so the names are read from the provider's documented protocol rather
// than off a run, and everything here degrades in the safe direction if a future
// version disagrees: an event this parser does not recognize is recorded whole
// and read as nothing, and an invocation whose terminal never arrives fails with
// exactly that reason rather than with an outcome nobody produced. The first
// real Codex stream this repository records is the evidence that should replace
// this paragraph.
