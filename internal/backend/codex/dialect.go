// Codex's operational dialect: how this provider says it is retrying, how it
// says a limit is refusing work, how to tell a server that could not serve the
// attempt apart from a request that will be refused however often it is asked,
// and how it says it has not got the model that was asked for.
//
// It is one implementation of the provider contract in internal/backend, exactly
// as the Claude Code dialect beside it is, and nothing above either of them
// special-cases a provider: the parser hands the dialect an event, the dialect
// answers with one of the contract's seven answers, and the harness alone
// decides what waiting that answer earns. The dialect states no duration
// anywhere, which is the property that keeps a provider from being able to spend
// an account.
