// Every place the harness asks a provider for work, and what happens at each of
// them when the answer is "no capacity".
//
// An exhausted usage limit is the one refusal that means hours in which nothing
// happens, so the claim the harness makes about it is a claim about every
// process rather than about the ones somebody remembered: any out-of-tokens
// refusal, wherever it is met, leaves a durable record the Slack sink says at
// warning severity. A claim of that shape cannot be held by enumerating the call
// sites in a comment, because the enumeration goes stale the first time somebody
// adds one — and the way it goes stale is silent, which is exactly the failure
// the claim exists to prevent.
//
// So the enumeration is a test. It reads the tree for every construction of a
// RunRequest, which is the one thing every provider invocation must build, and
// fails on any that this table does not account for. A new provider invocation
// therefore arrives with a failing test naming what it owes, rather than as a
// process that meets a limit and says nothing.
//
// It is deliberately a source sweep rather than a type assertion. Nothing in Go
// can express "and this call site records a refusal", so what is enforced is
// that the set is closed and that each member has a written account; the
// accounts themselves are held by the tests named in them.

// accounted for as a conversation turn above rather than as a call site of its
