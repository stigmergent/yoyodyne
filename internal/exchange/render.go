package exchange

// How an exchange reads: to the operator who is auditing it, and to the asking
// role that is waiting on it.
//
// Both renderings say the rounds and the cost together, always. That pairing is
// the point: rounds alone say how long a conversation went on and cost alone
// says what it came to, and the operator's question — was this worth it — is
// only answerable from the two side by side.
