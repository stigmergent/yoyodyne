package slack

// The outbound half of the decision tier: a line that has stopped is put to the
// operators where they will actually see it, as a question with an answer.
//
// Everything else this sink says is addressed to a channel, and a channel is the
// right place for an account of work: it is a narrative somebody reads when they
// come to it. A stopped line is not that. It is the one thing the harness cannot
// get past on its own, it is addressed to particular people rather than to
// whoever is reading, and the difference between it being seen in ten minutes
// and in ten hours is the whole cost of the state. So it is a direct message,
// and it is sent to every operator rather than to one: a decision addressed to a
// room is one each of them can reasonably assume somebody else is making.
//
// It is the degraded class of direct message the slack-reporting design admits
// — the system choosing nothing over ready work, which only a person fixes — and
// the state it is about is exactly the one the read model derives and the
// heartbeat says in the channel. Nothing here decides that the line is stopped;
// the feed hands this the ask beside the channel line, from the one derivation.
//
// The shape is two messages and it is deliberate. The top line is brief and
// carries the ask, because it is what a phone shows on a lock screen and what a
// mention in a sidebar has room for; the context, the age, what is waiting
// behind it and the options are threaded underneath, where somebody who has
// decided to deal with it is looking. An operator who reads only the first line
// still knows they are being waited on, which is the failure this whole tier
// exists to end.
//
// Nothing here acts on the answer. What a reply does is record a directive in
// the same durable record `yoyo directive record` writes and every run consults,
// which is what makes this a way of reaching the existing controls rather than a
// second set of them: no state is decided here, no role is invoked from here,
// and an operator who never replies has lost nothing but the message.

// Ask is one decision the operators are owed: what stopped the line, since when,

// second opinion about the record, which is exactly the disagreement an operator
// cannot adjudicate.
