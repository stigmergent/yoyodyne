// The inbound half of the decision tier: a reply in the thread the ask was made
// in is the decision.
//
// There is no other way to answer, and that is the point rather than a
// limitation. A button would be a control surface with its own vocabulary, an
// approval link would be a second authority over the work, and a command to type
// somewhere else would be a decision made at a terminal — which is the terminal
// the operator was not sitting at, which is why they were asked here. The reply
// is in the thread that asked, so what was decided is beside what was asked, and
// anybody reading it afterwards has both.
//
// It creates no machinery, exactly as a reply in a work item's thread creates
// none. What a decision records is one operational directive in the durable
// record every run consults: the same kind, the same store, the same reading,
// and no pause — the operator's answer is in force from the moment it is
// recorded and nothing waits on it. The one difference from a thread reply is
// the scope, and it is the honest one. A reply in an item's thread is about that
// item; this was asked about the whole line, so what it records is unscoped, and
// an unscoped directive is what the record already means by direction that
// reaches everything.
//
// Nothing here carries the decision out. The harness does not lift its own
// operator hold because somebody typed 1, and it must not: the switches are the
// operator's, the records are what agents read, and a surface that acted on its
// own reading of a chat message would be a second thing deciding what the
// harness does.

// decideThread answers one message that arrived somewhere other than the channel
// this sink reports in, which is a direct message.
//
// A conversation this sink asked nothing in is left alone, for the reason a
// channel thread it never opened is: somebody messaging the app about something
// else is having their own conversation, and an app that answered it would be
// talking over them. The decision map is the whole of the correlation — it is
// what says a thread was an ask, which state it was about, and what the numbers
// in it stood for.
//
// A message typed in the conversation rather than in the ask's thread is
// answered rather than dropped, and it is the case worth being careful about. It
// is the likeliest way somebody answers at all: a phone notification opens the
// flat conversation, so the reply that took the least effort to send is the one
// that lands outside the thread. Nothing can be recorded from it — which ask it
// answers is exactly what the thread was carrying, and a conversation may hold
// several — so what it gets is the one thing that is never acceptable to
// withhold: being told it was not recorded, and where to say it again.
//
// A message that @-mentions this app is the other thing never met with silence,
// here as in the reporting channel: outside an ask's thread it goes through the
// mention door exactly as it would at the top of the channel, answered in the
// conversation it was said in. That is read ahead of the decision map, so a map
// that cannot be read never costs somebody who addressed the app their answer.
// Inside an ask's thread the reply is the decision, mention or not, because that
// thread exists to take one.
