// A recurring task whose firings keep failing before their first turn, said
// once as a warning and once more as critical.
//
// From 06:39Z on 2026-09-26 every development manager sweep failed before its
// first turn, six times in a row, and every triage decision the sweeps would
// have made waited a day. The only account was a line per firing in the sweep
// log, and the operator's assistant found it by reading the log.
//
// The failure is read from the same derivation the attention line reads, so
// the channel says a task is failing exactly when `yoyo status` lists it. It is
// said twice at most per failure: as a warning when it is first seen, from the
// second failed firing in a row, and as critical once it has stood two hours,
// taken to the operators directly then. It is not repeated beyond that — the
// attention line carries it while it stands — and it stops when a firing takes
// a turn, because the derivation then no longer lists it and its marks are
// dropped, so a later failure is said afresh.
