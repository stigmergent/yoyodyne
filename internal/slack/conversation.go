// The product manager's own conversation, reached from this channel.
//
// The door in mention.go answers where things stand and, before this, said of
// everything else that it could not do it yet. This is what it does instead: an
// operator says something to this app and the product manager answers, in the
// thread they said it in and in its own voice.
//
// It creates no conversation of its own, and that is the whole of why a channel
// is allowed to hold one at all. What it speaks into is the durable conversation
// `yoyo chat` opens, keyed by the agent that holds it, recorded in the same state
// root and resumed from the same provider session — so a question asked at a
// terminal is answered from a phone and carried back to the terminal, because
// there is one conversation and two clients of it rather than two conversations
// that have to be reconciled. Nothing here keeps a transcript, a session, or a
// turn count: what this sink stores about a turn is what it always stored about
// a message, which is that it has already acted on it.
//
// Four rules hold the channel to that.
//
// Authority is the thread reply's, unchanged. Talking to the product manager
// admits work, reorders the queue, and spends the operator's money, so it is for
// the humans the project granted direct-work who bound a Slack member id and for
// nobody else. Somebody the project recognizes and granted nothing is told which
// grant they are missing; a stranger is stranger.go's, and neither is answered
// with silence.
//
// The wait is bounded, and bounded here rather than asked of the callee. A
// conversation turn can take many minutes, and steering work from inside one can
// wait on a provider's usage limit for hours — which is right at a terminal,
// where somebody chose to wait, and wrong in a channel, where the only thing
// distinguishable from a slow answer is a dead sink. So one turn gets
// DefaultConversationDeadline and then the thread is told what happened, whether
// that is capacity, the conversation being held elsewhere, or anything else.
//
// The shape of that bound is the point, and a deadline on a context is not it. A
// context is a request to stop, and a callee that does not answer one — a
// blocking read, a sleep somebody wrote without a select, a subprocess wait —
// leaves the caller waiting exactly as long as it would have anyway. So the call
// runs beside the wait rather than inside it: the turn is answered when the
// deadline passes whether or not anything underneath has returned, which is what
// makes this a bound on what the operator waits for rather than a hope about
// somebody else's code.
//
// What that costs is stated rather than hidden. A call nobody is listening to
// any more is still running and still holding the durable conversation, so the
// turn's own guard is given back by the call when it finishes rather than by the
// wait when it gives up — a message arriving in between is told the product
// manager is still answering, which is true, instead of being sent to contend
// for a lease it cannot win. The terminal meets the same hold: `yoyo chat`
// queues behind a turn in flight and says so, so the overdue answer says that
// rather than sending the operator to a client that will make them wait without
// having been told why. The abandoned call is deliberately not something the
// sink's shutdown waits on: waiting on it is the hang this exists to remove.
//
// One turn at a time, said out loud. The durable conversation admits one holder,
// so a second turn started while one is running would be refused by the lease
// rather than queued; this refuses it a moment earlier and in words, which is the
// same answer with somebody actually told.
//
// And it runs off the connection. The connection is a read loop Slack expects to
// keep reading, so a turn taken on it would hold every other message in the
// channel behind one operator's question.
