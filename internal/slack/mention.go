// The door: a message that addresses this app is always answered.
//
// The sink answers inside the threads it opened and is silent everywhere else,
// which is right for a reporting channel and wrong for exactly one case. An
// operator who @-mentions the app at the top of the channel is not talking to
// the channel — they are talking to the harness, and the top level had no
// handler at all, so three of those in a row on 2026-08-31 were not answered,
// not refused, and not even written down. Silence there is indistinguishable
// from a sink that has died, which is the one reading a reporting process must
// never leave somebody with.
//
// So this is the second stated exception to answering only inside this sink's
// own threads, and it is drawn as narrowly as the first: a message that names
// this app's member id is answered where it was said, and a message that does
// not is left exactly as alone as it always was. Nothing here records a
// directive, changes anything, or reads any record the operator could not
// already read in this channel — the four lines below are the same four lines
// the heartbeat posts to the same channel.
//
// What it does keep is what was said. A message addressed to this app goes into
// the sink's own log with the operator's own words in it, before the answer is
// posted and whether or not the workspace takes the answer, because "not even
// written down" is half of what the silence cost: an operator who was answered
// badly can at least be shown what they asked, and one who was not answered at
// all cannot be shown anything. It is a note of having been heard rather than a
// directive — nothing reads it, and no work moves because of it.
//
// Who is asking decides which door they get. Everything below is for somebody
// this project recognizes — a human its `operators` mapping names, whether or
// not it granted them anything — because answering is not steering and the four
// lines are already posted to this channel. A message from anybody else is
// answered once with a refusal naming who to contact instead, which is
// stranger.go's.
//
// Three answers now. A question about where things stand gets the read model's
// own four lines, because that derivation is the read model's and a surface that
// assembled its own would be a second answer to the one question an operator
// asks most. Everything else an operator says reaches the product manager, in
// the durable conversation `yoyo chat` holds rather than in one of this
// channel's own — which is conversation.go's, and is what makes a question begun
// at a terminal answerable from a phone and back again.
//
// The sentence saying what this app cannot do is still here and is now the last
// resort rather than the ordinary case: a sink assembled without the
// conversation, and somebody the project recognizes but has granted nothing,
// both get an answer in words rather than silence.
