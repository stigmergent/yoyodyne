// The provider answering nobody, said once to the people who end it, and once
// more when it answers again.
//
// From 2026-09-17 18:17 local the operator's Claude Code login had expired.
// Every dispatch was refused, every recurring pass recorded 0 turns, the runs
// already going spent their relaunch budgets and blocked, and the intake brake
// tripped over three of them — which was the one thing that did reach the
// channel, and it prescribed `yoyo release`, which lifts nothing here. The
// operator learned what had happened by asking, three days later, and the
// assistant lifted the brake by hand.
//
// This is shaped the opposite way from the capacity hold beside it, on purpose.
// A hold is repeated every heartbeat while it stands, because a person can end
// it early only by changing the configuration and needs reminding. An outage is
// said once, tagged to the operators by member id — it is both important and
// theirs to act on, which is the communication rule's own test for a tag — and
// then left alone: the line's own banner carries it while it stands, and what a
// repeated message would buy is a reason to mute the channel. When the provider
// answers again the operator is told once more, as a note, because they were
// told the line had stopped and are owed being told it carried on by itself.
