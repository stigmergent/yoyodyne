// The other thing the sink says that no record said first, and the harder one:
// that nothing at all is happening.
//
// The heartbeat beside this says a state the record already holds — held,
// braked, idle — again while it stands. That works while something is alive to
// write the record down. On 2026-09-01 the watch session died on a transient
// tracker read and wrote nothing at all, and for seven and a half hours every
// surface here was correct and silent: no hold, no stop, no idle poll, no run,
// nothing. The operator found it by noticing.
//
// So the absence is read instead: nothing has started since a moment the runs
// themselves date; the tracker says work is ready; no hold, no full machine and
// no run in flight accounts for it. That reading needs no cooperation from the
// process it is about, which is the whole point — a dead scheduler cannot file a
// report about being dead, and a wedged one files that it is watching. It is
// taken by internal/watchdog and written down against the product, and what this
// file does is say what the record is worth — and keep saying it, louder, for as
// long as the record says the line is still stopped.
//
// The sink says it and does not produce it, and that division is the whole of
// what yoyodyne-ifd.295 moved. The sink's loop was chosen originally because it
// outlives the scheduler, which is true and is not enough: Slack reporting is
// opt-in throughout — an observation and never a gate — so a product that never
// started a sink recorded no stalls at all and its `yoyo status` history was
// permanently empty. The instrument that exists so silence is impossible cannot
// hang off an optional process, which is the same lesson the provider's usage
// window taught one layer down. So the reading and the record are
// internal/watchdog's, run from machinery that is always running, and what is
// left here is what was always this surface's: reading what the record already
// holds, and deciding that this particular message is worth somebody's phone.
//
// # Nothing here may be a model-based watcher
//
// This loop is plain Go reading durable files, and it has to stay that way. Every
// watcher the harness has that asks a model something — the development
// manager's sweep, any role turn — pauses with the provider's usage window, so a
// watchdog built on one goes to sleep at exactly the moment the thing it watches
// goes quiet, and wakes up when there was nothing left to notice. That is the
// lesson 2026-09-05 taught: the window that produced ninety minutes of silence
// would also have silenced any watcher that had to ask a provider whether the
// harness was alive. So the whole path stays free of provider calls, directly or
// transitively, on this side of it as much as on the checker's.
//
// The other half of that boundary is what this must not do. Noticing is a
// surface's; restarting whatever died is not, and it is not moved here by the
// fact that this is the loop still awake. A sink that restarted the watch session
// would be a second thing that invokes and supervises the harness's processes,
// and the operator's own interim script — thirty minutes of quiet, then force a
// restart — retires by its detection half landing in the checker and its restart
// half landing where restarts already live: the session's own bounded exit
// (yoyodyne-ifd.288) under the supervisor that starts it (internal/supervise).

// DefaultStallEscalation is how long a line may stand stopped on a person
// before it stops being a warning and is said as critical.
//
// Two hours is two heartbeats: the warning is said, said once more an hour on
// for a reader who was away for the first, and the repetition after that is
// critical. That is well short of the capacity hold's bar and deliberately so. A
// capacity hold has a timer that ends it and a person only ends it early; a
// stall has no timer at all — nothing the record holds accounts for it, so
// nothing but a person ends it — and a brake hold the development manager has
// escalated is a hold she has already decided is a person's. A stopped line
// that has stood through two intervals with nobody acting on the warning is past
// being one.

// It costs nothing but a read of the product's own stall log: what is ready to
// pull, when anything last started and what accounts for it are the checker's
// questions, asked wherever the checker runs. Two readings of one machine is a
// disagreement only the operator could adjudicate, and a sink deriving its own
// would be exactly that — so this reads the answer rather than repeating the
// work.
//
// It used to be said once per stall and then nothing while it stood, on the
// reasoning that a machine that has stopped is either looked at or it is not.
// On 2026-09-07 it was not: the alarm fired at 02:48Z, said nothing more by
// design, and a line fully stopped for over four hours had produced one message,
// four hours old, by the time anybody read it. The operator's direction inverted
// the design. A line that is completely stopped is the most serious thing this
// surface reports, so it gets louder rather than quieter: said again every
// heartbeat while the stall stands, as a warning while it is young and critical
// once it has stood past the bar above, to the operators directly and tagged to
// them by member id every time. The repetition is also a re-reading — the cause
// and the next mover are taken fresh from the record each time — so a louder
// message is a more current one rather than only a more frequent one.
