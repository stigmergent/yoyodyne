package slack

// Surviving a long gap: how fast the sink posts, and what it does with a backlog
// too deep to post one message at a time.
//
// Both halves exist because of the same discovery. Slack does not delay an
// application that posts faster than it tolerates — it suppresses, and a
// suppressed message is hidden permanently rather than late. An unpaced catch-up
// therefore turns this design's arrive-late-never-dropped promise into
// dropped-from-view for whatever overflowed, which is the one outcome the
// durable record cannot repair from the reader's side: they never see there was
// anything to look for.
//
// So posting is paced to what Slack sustains, and a backlog deeper than a reader
// would scroll is digested per thread rather than replayed. The digest is not a
// concession to the rate limit — four hundred replayed messages hide the signal
// as thoroughly as suppression does, and nobody scrolls them. One line per
// thread saying how much accumulated, with the durable record named as the full
// account, is what both the workspace and the reader actually want.
