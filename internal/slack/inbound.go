package slack

// The inbound half: a reply in a work item's thread reaches the work as a
// durable directive.
//
// It creates no directive machinery, and that is the whole of why a thread is
// allowed to steer anything. A reply is a new *receiver* for the record `yoyo
// directive record` already writes — same kinds, same pause semantics, same
// resolution, same store the run pipeline consults before it starts a run,
// before it resumes one, and before it puts a change through its gate. A
// directive recorded from a thread is indistinguishable downstream from one
// typed at a terminal, which is what "enforceable regardless of which agent
// received it" costs and all it costs. Nothing here can weaken directive
// governance, because nothing here has governance of its own to weaken.
//
// Four rules hold the channel to that:
//
// Only an instruction reaches the record. A reply is read for what it is for
// before anything is written down — the directive package's own stated rule,
// not a classifier — and a question is carried to the product manager's
// conversation instead, with her answer returned to the thread; a reply the
// rule will not decide is asked back in one line. The record used to take
// everything, and on 2026-08-30 it took the operator's question about a phrase
// in a receipt as a standing instruction and acknowledged it with the same
// phrase. A question in the directive record is a directive nobody gave, and
// enforceability presumes there are none.
//
// The pausing kinds are stated, never inferred. A reply opening `ambiguous:` or
// `artifact:` records that kind and must say what is unresolved; everything else
// is operational. A classifier deciding which sentences stop work is exactly
// what the command line already refused, and it would be worse here, where the
// input is chat. The intent reading above cannot stop work either: at most it
// answers, or asks.
//
// Authority defaults closed. A reply acts only when its Slack member id belongs
// to a human the project granted direct-work, and the derivation of that list is
// the configuration's rather than this file's. An unlisted reply is answered in
// the thread saying it was not acted on, because a channel that silently ignores
// some people looks broken rather than closed — and a reply from somebody the
// project does not recognize at all is a different case with a different answer,
// which is stranger.go's.
//
// Every message this reads is answered in its own thread — the directive as
// recorded, or the refusal with its reason — and the answer tags whoever wrote
// it. The answer names no identifier anywhere: the person being answered typed
// what is being read back to them, and a slug in an acknowledgment is the one
// thing in it they would have to go and resolve. The identifier the record keeps
// is for the processes that read directives, which is where it stays.
//
// Nothing this reads asks for one either. A reply settles what this thread is
// waiting on by saying how it was settled, and which directive that is comes out
// of the read model — because a channel that showed nobody an identifier and then
// required one would send an operator to a terminal to look up the name of
// something they paused from their phone.
//
// An operator who steers from a phone has nothing else to tell them whether they
// were heard, and a thread they are not looking at is
// indistinguishable from silence. The reply itself wears where its directive
// stands as well: heard while the directive is open, settled once it is, refused
// where nothing was recorded at all.
//
// What is recorded here is also remembered here: which thread each directive was
// said in, by whom, and in which message. The durable directive record holds none
// of it, deliberately — it is the product's record of what was directed, the same
// whichever way it arrived — so the sink keeps its own note, and the delivery pass
// reads it to say what later became of what somebody asked for, where they asked
// and to them.
