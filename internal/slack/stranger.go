package slack

// The same door, for somebody the project does not recognize.
//
// Two exceptions to answering only inside this sink's own threads are already
// stated — a reply in one of them, and a message that @-mentions the app. This
// is the third and the last, and it is the only one that is about who is
// speaking rather than where. Somebody whose Slack member id is bound to nobody
// in the `operators` mapping is a stranger to this project: they cannot steer
// the work, and until now what they got for trying was either a refusal written
// for an operator who mistyped their own member id, or the four lines. Neither
// tells a person the true thing, which is that this app does not know them and
// there is a human who does.
//
// So they are told, once, in words the operator wrote: this app does not know
// them, and who to reach out to instead. The contacts are the humans the
// `operators` mapping names, because that mapping is the whole of who this
// project recognizes — a list of people to contact maintained anywhere else
// would be a second answer to the same question, and the one that goes stale.
//
// Once per thread, and that bound is the rule rather than an optimization. A
// refusal that repeated would let anybody at all make this app talk as much as
// they liked in a channel it is supposed to report in, and an app that can be
// made chatty by strangers is one an operator turns off. Every attempt after the
// first is written down in the sink's own log and answered with nothing, which
// is the same shape every other bound here takes: what was said is kept, and
// what is said back is bounded.
//
// It never names a stranger to the workspace by mention. The contacts are named
// in the words the mapping files them under rather than as `<@id>`, so telling
// somebody who to ask does not notify those people every time an unknown user
// opens a thread — which would hand exactly the sender this exists to bound a
// way of reaching the operators anyway.
