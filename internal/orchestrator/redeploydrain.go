// A run stopped for the redeploy of the session hosting it.
//
// A watching session that finds a build deployed over it waits out the runs it
// hosts before it restarts, and the wait is bounded: past
// execution.redeploy_drain_limit the session restarts anyway. What that costs
// the run it was hosting is this file. The session cancels the run's context
// with RedeployDrain as the cause, the run's pipeline reads that cause where
// it turns a stopped step into an ending, and instead of the cancelled run a
// killed process leaves — item still claimed, work to be developed again from
// scratch — it records a stop the session that comes back can continue from:
// the phase it was at, in the worktree and developer session it already has,
// with every counter as it was.
//
// It is the same shape as a provider the harness stopped on time, and
// deliberately so: both are the harness's own clock ending an invocation the
// provider had not finished, and both leave the run in flight and resumable.
// What differs is what the run is owed. A stopped provider is owed the rest of
// the attempt it was making; a run stopped at its checks is owed the gate from
// the checks, and one stopped at its review is owed the gate again, because a
// verdict half-made is no verdict.
