// Re-arming a publication's merge on the development manager's decision, with
// nobody typing a verb.
//
// One publication is re-armed on no decision at all: a merge the reconciling
// sweep withdrew because its checks failed on the target itself (redtarget.go).
// It waits on the items filed for that check, and once every one of them is
// closed the harness arms it again here, on a head level with its target whose
// checks now pass, spending no re-arm (yoyodyne-m5p).
//
// Two publications reach her docket as ones a re-arm can finish: a promoted,
// approved run whose record holds its pull request and says nothing ever asked
// the forge to merge it, and one whose queued merge the forge dropped. She
// decides either: a re-arm, or a re-run. A re-run is fired by the ordinary
// carry-out, because it is a run and takes a developer slot. A re-arm is not a
// run. It is one merge request, made by the Rearmer under the target branch's
// promotion lease, and it holds no slot and leaves no run to wait out — so it is
// fired here, on its own path, once per pull, rather than dressed up as a started
// run the pass would then account for as one.
//
// Until yoyodyne-ifd.429.31 nothing fired the first, and until yoyodyne-ifd.428.46
// nothing fired the second: each waited for somebody to type `yoyo triage rearm`.
// What is fired is exactly what the verb would make — the same action, reached
// by the same run — so the gates are the Rearmer's own: the forge's merge state,
// a head behind its target and a failing check on a first arming, the pre-merge
// check on the remote target, the decision standing and not yet carried out. The
// sweep offers a publication only where the Rearmer's own reading of the record
// says it can repeat one, so what the watch attempts and what the verb would
// accept cannot come apart.
//
// Every attempt that does not fire is written onto the item's triage record
// exactly as a refused re-run's is, where the development manager reads it. A
// refusal by the Rearmer is paced the same way. The operator's pause and the
// intake hold stop it as they stop every other carry-out: the decision is written
// onto the item as waiting on that switch, once for each time it closes, and the
// first pull after it opens attempts the decision. A re-arm held back by a run of
// its item in flight is handed to RecordUnattempted with the others, so a decision
// no pass attempts for a poll interval is said on the item too.
