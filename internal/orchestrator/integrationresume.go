// Resuming the integration of an approved change the environment stopped.
//
// This is the fourth thing the harness does about a docketed stoppage, and it
// is unlike the other three in one way that decides everything about it: it
// carries out no decision, because there was nothing to decide. The reviewer
// approved the change, and what stopped it short of the target branch was the
// environment — a primary checkout carrying somebody's uncommitted edit, a
// tracker read that timed out under load, a forge or a network that went away.
// None of that is a verdict on the work, and none of it is a question a
// development manager answers.
//
// The cause is read off the error that ended the run and never off the run's
// prose afterwards: a dirty checkout, a killed replay, a target the harness
// would not catch up, and a remote that refused the harness's credential each
// by the sentinel declared for it, and a transport that did not answer by the
// recovery package's closed reading of the error — the same reading that
// decides what the harness waits out and asks again at the boundaries that have
// a window, applied here to a step that has none. The diverged target and the
// refused credential are cleared by a person, but what they clear is the
// branches or the key rather than the change, so they are resumed like the
// rest once cleared, and refused in words that say what clears them until then. A worktree the convergence
// sweep retires while the run stands stopped is not a cause at all but a
// condition met at resume, and it is put back from the branch.
//
// Every verb that could pick such a run up before this existed spent something
// for it. A repair needs a failure returned to the developer and there was none,
// so it was refused; a re-run starts the item over and buys a fresh run and a
// fresh review for a change nobody disputed. yoyodyne-ifd.309's approved change
// stopped this way twice, and four operator overrides were signed to get it onto
// the target, every one paying for the environment rather than a verdict. This
// is the verb that ends that: the run resumes at the promotion it stopped short
// of, with its approval standing, and the item's counters stay where the review
// left them.
//
// # What it asks, and in what order
//
// Everything that can refuse is asked before anything is written, for the reason
// the repair action asks first: a re-entry half made — an item put back and a
// run not made live, or the reverse — is a state nothing else here notices. The
// record has to say the run is one of these; the checkout has to be one a
// promotion can be made from, because the run was refused for exactly that once
// already and re-entering it into the same refusal would make the run live for
// nothing; the item has to be one a run may continue on; and the harness has to
// have room. Then the worktree: as the harness left it and still holding the
// change, because what is promoted is whatever is in it. A worktree the
// convergence sweep retired while the run stood stopped is put back first, from
// the branch at the commit the run recorded — the branch still holds every
// commit the reviewer approved, so a retired checkout is a directory to
// recreate rather than a change to re-derive. That restore is the one write
// made before the re-entry, and it is recorded on the run as it is made, so a
// refusal after it leaves a stopped run whose checkout is back rather than a
// record that says the checkout is gone. Then the item is put back, the run is
// made live at the integrating phase, and the pipeline is asked to continue
// exactly that run.
//
// # What it charges
//
// Nothing. The resumption is recorded on the run as a continuation — the record
// of a run that was put back at its promotion — and not as an attempt: the
// repair count, the review evidence, and every counter on the item's durable
// triage record are untouched. A replay that conflicts is the one outcome that
// leaves this path, and it leaves it exactly as any replay conflict does: the
// run stops, both sides are preserved, and the blocker names it for a person.
