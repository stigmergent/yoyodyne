// Closure follows the kind of landing a run claimed, not the fact that it
// landed. The case these tests exist for is a real one: a run answered a work
// item it could not do yet with a diagnosis that said so in bold, the diagnosis
// integrated because it was good evidence, and the item closed against it —
// because closure mechanically followed integration and read nothing of what
// had landed. Both kinds are driven through the whole pipeline here rather than
// asserted over a hand-built state, because a test that set the claim itself
// would pass just as happily if nothing ever read one off a developer's reply.
