// The parity harness: the built-in delivery definitions walked against the
// recorded baseline of what the hard-coded pipeline actually does.
//
// What it is for is the one claim a definition cannot make about itself. Any
// well-formed state machine compiles; the question is whether this one is the
// pipeline, and the only answer worth anything is the frozen behaviour in
// testdata/baseline. So every recorded path is written down here as a
// transcript -- the states the run stood in and the outcome it produced in each
// -- and each transcript is put through two doors that have to agree.
//
// The witness holds a transcript against the trace it claims to describe. A
// developer invocation in the trace is a `develop` state in the transcript, a
// verdict is a `review` state, `repair_attempts` is the number of times the
// transcript went back to the developer from the gate, `integration_retries` is
// the number of `superseded` outcomes, and the commands the event log records
// are the check states that got as far as running them. A transcript that
// claims a path the trace does not evidence fails there, which is what stops
// this file from being a story about the pipeline rather than a reading of it.
//
// The executor walks the transcript through the real graph. The definition is
// compiled by the same loader, under the same grant, from the same bytes the
// build ships, and stepped by `internal/workflow`'s own executor, so a
// transition the definition does not have is a step that fails rather than a
// mismatch nobody notices. What the doors perform is replaced by nothing at all:
// the actions are the registered ones -- their names, their capabilities and
// what they wrap, taken from the same table `actions.go` builds the delivery
// registry from -- with Perform swapped for a function that does nothing, so the
// walk is over the real topology without claiming a work item or promoting
// anything. That is the whole of what "compiled and executed only under the test
// harness" means here.
//
// What it does not do is compare a run's durable record field for field, and it
// could not: everything the pipeline does outside its eight registered steps --
// the pre-claim questions, the pauses, the budgets -- is Go control flow behind
// no door, so there is nothing to execute that would produce a record to
// compare. The traces stay the measure; this measures the sequence against them,
// and the change summary says which paths that leaves unmeasured. What a step
// does rather than when it runs is held where the door can actually be performed
// -- run.complete's tracker writes are in actions_test.go, because a walk whose
// doors perform nothing cannot tell a run that closed its item from one that did
// not.
