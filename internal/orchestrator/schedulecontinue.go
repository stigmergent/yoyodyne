// Continuing a run paused on work its item waits on.
//
// A run that reaches a gate boundary while its item waits on unfinished work
// records the pause and exits, keeping its claim, its branch, its worktree, and
// its developer session. Its item stays claimed, so no pull ever offers it
// again, and until yoyodyne-ifd.428.51 the only thing that continued it was
// somebody typing `yoyo run` once the work it waited on closed — a hand step,
// and one nobody is told to take. So every pull reads the runs paused this way,
// asks the tracker what each item still waits on, and continues the ones whose
// dependencies have all closed, in the same way `yoyo run` would have.

// ScheduleContinuations is what a pull reads to continue runs paused on work
// their items wait on: the item as the tracker holds it now, and a stop somebody
// recorded on the run. It is optional, and a pull wired without one continues
// nothing, leaving such a run to `yoyo run` as before. The continuation is
// recorded on the item by the run itself, where its pause is actually lifted,
// so a continuation refused before it got that far writes nothing there.

// developer slots and the session's --limit allow. A run whose dependency is

// recorded on it: a stop is honoured before any continuation, and the sweep ends
// such a run at once, so this never picks it up.
//
// A run paused this way gave its developer slot back as it recorded the pause
// (runstate.State.HoldsDeveloperSlot), so the pull's occupied runs do not count
// it and continuing it takes a free slot exactly as a pulled item does. A run
// that is counted there already holds one and takes no other. Either way the
// store's own capacity check is what finally decides, when the continued run is
// adopted and takes its slot back (Store.ReclaimSlot).
//
// free and started are this pull's free slots and how many runs the session has
// started; both are what the carry-outs above left of them.
