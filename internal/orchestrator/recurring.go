// Waking a role on a cadence, with nobody standing there to do the waking.
//
// Everything else the harness starts is reactive: an item is admitted, a run
// stops, an operator asks. The work that has no trigger is the standing kind — a
// look over what has gone unresolved, at intervals, whether or not anything
// happened — and until now the only thing that could start it was a person
// remembering to. That person is what this replaces, and it replaces nothing
// else: the role woken is the role the configuration names, the conversation is
// its own, the authority is the one its role already holds, and what it does
// about what it finds it does through the paths it already acts through.
//
// # What configuration decides, and what it cannot
//
// Which role, how often, what to say, whether the task is on, and which model
// its turns ask for where it names one. That is the whole of it. The model is a
// spend decision rather than an authority: the turn is the role's, under the
// role's account and failover, holding what the role holds, and a turn the task
// does not cover asks for the role's own model. There is no configuration key
// here for a capability, a tool, an
// account, or an authority of any kind, and the absence is the point: a schedule
// that could widen what a role may do would make the schedule the place to look
// for what the harness is allowed to do, which is exactly what keeping capability
// in trusted code exists to prevent. A recurring turn is authorized identically
// to a conversation an operator opens by hand, because it is one.
//
// # One firing per pass, and turns inside it
//
// A pass fires at most one task, for the reason a pass delivers at most one
// stoppage: a firing is conversation turns, and a pass that fired three tasks
// would hold the queue closed for as long as all three took. The next pass takes
// the next due task, and on a poll loop that is a minute later.
//
// Inside a firing, turns iterate. A pass with more to do than one turn holds says
// so in its own account and is given another, up to the task's bound. That is the
// alternative to the two things a single turn forces: a role rushing a morning's
// work into bounds that will not hold it, or one silently truncating at whatever
// limit it hit. Both look identical to a reader afterwards — a short report — and
// the whole value of a recurring pass is that its reports can be believed.
//
// # A firing that failed waits for its next cadence
//
// This is the deliberate opposite of the escalation beside it, and the store
// says why: a stoppage that failed to reach the development manager is one
// specific thing nobody has heard about, and a recurring pass that failed is run
// again at its next cadence anyway, because the next pass looks at everything
// this one would have. What a fast retry would buy is turns spent against a
// provider that is out of capacity, once per pull, for as long as the outage
// lasts.
//
// # The pause and not the intake hold
//
// A firing is a provider invocation, so the operator's pause covers it exactly as
// it covers a run, a conversation turn, and a delivery. The intake hold is
// deliberately not read: holding intake stops the harness choosing work, and this
// chooses nothing, claims nothing, and starts nothing — what it produces is a
// role looking at what has already gone wrong, which is usually what a held
// queue is waiting on.
//
// # An owning role is put the changes proposed to its documents
//
// A role that owns documents — the architect the designs, specifications, and
// decisions; the product manager the brief and the goals — is woken with the
// undecided changes other roles have proposed to them, oldest first and bounded
// to what one pass can argue, and asked to recommend on each: approve, decline,
// or merge with another, with the reason. The recommendations ride the account
// and the account is the batch the operator decides from. Nothing here decides
// a proposal: no role records a decision and the operator does, from `yoyo
// amendment`, under the owner's authority. What this adds is that the argument
// the owner is entitled to make is made on a cadence rather than only when
// somebody opens the conversation — forty-four proposals stood undecided for
// weeks before it did, because nothing woke the architect to argue them.
//
// The proposals ride the wake rather than the conversation's own delivery of
// them, for the reason the brake's entries do: the conversation carries each
// proposal into a turn once, ever, and a cadence needs the queue as it stands
// on each firing — minus what the owner already argued on an earlier pass, so a
// batch nobody has decided is not re-argued every cadence and the pass moves on
// to what has not been argued yet.

// an hourly task writes under nine thousand a year — and `yoyo sweeps --json`
// already reads all of it on demand. What the reading assumes is that the log
// is never pruned or rotated: nothing here does either, and a log cut back
// would forget the requests its lost records reported, so every one of those
// still open would be stated once more on the next pass. Once more and not
// hourly — the pass that restates them records them again.

// more; that is one repeat for one torn write, and the alternative — reading

// week, which has already cost this project a full run and two review rounds
// twice.

// after an approved change stopped at integration, and decided nothing about it
// or the two that stopped after it.
//
