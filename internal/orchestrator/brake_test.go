// The intake brake summoning the development manager and releasing itself.
//
// Every test here replays the shape of 2026-09-19T17:56Z: three runs blocked in
// a row, the brake tripped, and — until this — the line sat held for two hours
// with a free developer slot idle because a person had to notice. What the
// operator asked for was the development manager invoked at once and nothing
// waiting, and each test below is one of the ways the hold now ends without a
// person: her decision, or a probe run that lands. The one that does wait on a
// person is the one she escalated, and that is tested too.
