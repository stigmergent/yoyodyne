// The verb both roles have for the work item that cannot be met as it stands.
//
// The two shapes it exists for are replayed here rather than asserted over a
// hand-built state, because what the item was about is the price: before it, the
// honest can-be-done-by-nobody finding had only expensive exits. A reviewer that
// saw acceptance criteria a ruling forbade could only ask for repair, round after
// round, until the item's budget ran out and the stoppage reached the development
// manager that way — yoyodyne-ifd.100.1 spent three runs and six review rounds
// doing exactly that. A developer in the same position could only land a
// diagnosis, which yoyodyne-ifd.284 then closed its item against.
//
// So each test below asserts the price as well as the routing: one round, no
// repair attempt, nothing integrated, and one entry on the docket.
