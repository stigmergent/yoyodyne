// Putting a stopped run in front of the development manager, with nobody
// carrying it there.
//
// A run that fails independent review after every permitted attempt is docketed
// as it stops, and the docket is delivered into the development manager's
// conversation when she opens one. Between those two facts sat a person. The
// stoppage was durable and the docket was assembled and her authority to decide
// was wired, and none of it moved until somebody opened her conversation and
// told her a run had stopped — which is the operator standing in as the
// harness's messenger, in the one workflow that exists so they do not have to
// stand in as its eyes.
//
// So the harness delivers it. What that changes is the courier and nothing else:
// the evidence is the docket entry she would have read anyway, the decision is
// hers and is recorded where every triage decision is recorded, the caps still
// refuse what they refused, and nothing here carries a decision out. What carries
// one out is the same pull, a step later and under every gate the verbs already
// ask; see carryout.go, which is the other end of this loop.
//
// # What is delivered, and what is not
//
// Two entries, and both for the same reason: the next step is a judgment rather
// than a fix.
//
// The first is the 2-of-2 review stoppage — a run that ended on a durable blocker
// with its reviewer still requiring repair. A failing check, a refused path, and
// a replay conflict are all stoppages too, and each is a different question. They
// stay on the docket for her to read, exactly as before, rather than being
// delivered by a rule nobody has argued for yet.
//
// The second is an escalation: a developer or a reviewer having said, in the
// round it reached, that the work item cannot be met as it stands. It is the one
// entry that asks for a decision in so many words, so a rule that delivered the
// stoppage and left this to be noticed would be delivering the expensive half of
// the same question and holding back the cheap one — which is the whole of what
// yoyodyne-ifd.303 was for.
//
// Which of them a docket entry describes is read from the run's own record rather
// than from the entry's prose, for the reason every other triage action reads it
// there: the entry says what was true when it was written, and a classification
// made by matching words is one that changes when somebody rewrites a sentence.
//
// # One at a time, and only what nobody has judged
//
// A pass delivers one stopped run, and a run is delivered once however many
// entries it was docketed under: the docket she reads folds a run's entries into
// one (triage.Fold), and this walks the same fold, so a run docketed as the
// stoppage and as the escalation a role raised from it is put to her as one
// question rather than one per entry.
//
// A delivery is a conversation turn, and a pass
// that delivered a backlog of them at once would hold the queue closed for as
// long as the development manager took to answer all of them — so the oldest
// goes first, and the next pass takes the next. What that costs is that a
// morning with five stopped runs reaches her over five passes, which is the
// right trade for a loop that goes on choosing work while she reads.
//
// A delivery that failed is made again, up to the record's bound and no faster
// than its retry delay. The pacing is the half that is easy to leave out and
// makes the bound meaningless without it: whatever drives this decides how often
// it looks, and the loop that does today looks once per pull, so three attempts
// counted and not paced would be three attempts inside one command.
//
// And a stoppage she has already been given a repair grant or a re-run for is
// left alone, whether or not the harness has carried that decision out. Both are
// recorded against the item's budget the moment she decides, and acted on later,
// so between the two the stopped run still reads as untouched to anything looking
// only at the run — which is where every stoppage somebody carried to her by hand
// also sits. A decision costing nothing leaves no counter anywhere the harness
// reads, and is seen instead as the entry's own closure: every decision closes
// the entry it settles, and an entry a decision still holds over is nothing this
// delivers. A decision to wait holds only until the moment it names, so the
// stoppage it settled is delivered again after that — which is what waiting asked
// for.
//
// # Why the spending pause and not the intake hold
//
// A delivery is a provider invocation, so the operator's pause covers it exactly
// as it covers a run and a conversation turn: a paused harness delivers nothing,
// and nothing is claimed, so the stoppage keeps its delivery for after the pause
// is lifted.
//
// The intake hold is deliberately not read here, and the difference is what each
// switch is for. Holding intake stops the harness choosing work; this chooses
// nothing, claims nothing, and starts nothing. What it produces is the
// development manager's judgment about work that has already stopped — which is
// the thing a held queue is usually waiting on, and holding it back would be the
// hold answering a question nobody asked it.
