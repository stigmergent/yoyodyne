// An item a role raised as unmeetable, amended by its owner and run again.
//
// yoyodyne-ifd.437.13 is the shape: a reviewer raised the README rewrite because
// its done-means required a review that had been moved to another item, the
// development manager recorded a repair and then a re-run, and both were refused
// at carry-out because a raise is not a stopped run. The change the raising run
// made was sound and sat on its branch while nothing could pick it up. So the
// sequence is replayed end to end here — the raise through the pipeline, the
// owner's amendment and release on the item, the decision on the durable record,
// and the carry-out through the pipeline again — and what is asserted is where
// the fresh run started: from the raising run's change rather than from nothing.
