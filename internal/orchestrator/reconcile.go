// settleQueuedMerge asks the forge what became of a merge it queued, and

//
//   - The forge merged. The publication finishes exactly as it would have
//     inside the run: the remote target is confirmed to carry the promotion, the
//     merge commit the forge made of it is recorded, the local target branch is
//     caught up onto the merge commit, and the item is settled on that
//     confirmation — closed where its landing discharged it, put back where
//     it did not. The catch-up is done here rather than left to the
//     convergence sweep so that settling a merge is complete on its own: a
//     caller that settles runs without sweeping afterwards must not be the
//     difference between a converged checkout and one silently left behind. The
//     branch the merge consumed is deleted after the closure and cannot affect
//     it, which is what stops a reset connection at the last step of the
//     hygiene from leaving a finished item open.
//   - The forge is still holding the merge. Its checks are read and written
//     onto the publication, and a red one is decided on (settleStillQueued):
//     updated onto the target where it fell behind and failed on files its
//     change does not touch, handed back as a dropped merge otherwise. A merge
//     whose checks are not red stays outstanding, and a later sweep asks again.
//   - The forge dropped it: the request is closed, or open with no merge queued
//     for it any more. Something the base branch requires went unmet, and the
//     harness does not merge past a requirement — not with administrator
//     privileges, not by asking again. The publication is recorded as
//     outstanding and the item is handed to a person with a durable blocker
//     rather than closed as integrated: the run that promoted the change left
//     that closure to the forge's answer, and this is the answer. The change
//     itself is not at risk — the local target branch it was integrated into is
//     the authoritative one and moved before any of this — so what the blocker
//     asks for is the publication, which is where triage's bounded re-arm of a
