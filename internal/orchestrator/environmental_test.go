package orchestrator

// A round the environment refused, against a real repository.
//
// The field cases were items that had been granted a repair, dispatched into a
// clean worktree by a build that did not carry the gate the grant relied on, and
// charged for the round anyway. The grant was gone, the item was one step nearer
// its cap, and the escalation that followed reads afterwards as work nobody could
// finish.
//
// Each test asserts a different part of the class. That sequence with the
// accounting asserted: the run refuses, the round is classified environmental,
// and the item stands exactly where it stood before it. The same failure
// repeated past what the round budget has room for, which is the bound the item
// asks for rather than one case of it. The conjunction from the other side — an
// empty delivery with no environmental cause still spends. Each cause the
// harness recognizes from the failure alone rather than from a refusal site of
// its own. A granted round that never ran, whose worktree is full of what
// earlier rounds delivered and which is refused all the same. And the guarantee
// that a round turned away never lends its classification to the round after it.
