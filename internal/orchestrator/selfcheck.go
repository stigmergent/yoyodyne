// wrote one malformed claim has still run them: reading this out of the leftover
// would hand that developer back a refusal for evidence it had recorded, on top
// of the withheld closure it already has.
//
// An unreadable block is recorded as a problem rather than swallowed, for the
// reason an unreadable landing claim is: the developer that wrote one was trying
// to say what it ran, and "it wrote something nobody could read" and "it wrote
// nothing" are different facts to whoever reads this afterwards. Both fail the
