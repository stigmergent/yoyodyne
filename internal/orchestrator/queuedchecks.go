// A queued merge is read with its checks.
//
// Until yoyodyne-ifd.429.16 a merge the forge had queued was read for one thing
// only — whether it was still queued — and the record never carried whether it
// could land. Pull request 609 sat queued 33 hours against a red build; 713 sat
// 31 commits behind main failing two tests its change never touched, and the
// development manager waited on it because the record said the merge was
// queued; on 2026-09-25 four requests sat that way past every later merge, and
// each cost a person a look at the forge. A merge the forge is holding for
// checks that will never pass is not a merge that is going to happen.
//
// So every sweep that finds a merge still queued reads the head's checks too,
// writes them onto the publication, and decides on them:
//
//   - Checks passing or still running: the merge stays queued, with the
//     reading beside it.
//   - A head behind its target whose failing checks name no file the change
//     touches: the failure is one the change met rather than brought, and the
//     remedy is the one a promotion that lost its race takes. The queued merge
//     is withdrawn and the run is put back at its promotion, where the target
//     is found moved and the change is replayed onto it, checked and reviewed
//     again, and queued again — under the same integration-retry budget a
//     replay spends, and hosted by the sweep that hosts runs.
//   - Anything else red — a failing check naming a file the change touches, or a
//     head already level with its target, where nothing but the change differs
//     — is the change's own failure, or one no update can fix. The queued merge
//     is withdrawn and the item is handed back with the check named, as a
//     dropped merge is, rather than left queued.
