// The declarative path, driven against real runs, and the one key that rolls it
// back.
//
// The parity harness beside this file walks transcripts somebody wrote down and
// holds them against the recorded baseline. That answers whether the definitions
// can express what the pipeline did; it cannot answer whether a run happening
// now produces those transitions, because a transcript is written by hand and a
// run is not. This reads the instance back off the store after a real run, so
// what is compared is a sequence the run actually produced against the
// transcript the harness measures that same path by. A divergence here is the
// observation being wrong about the pipeline.
//
// The runs are the baseline's own scenarios rather than copies of them, which is
// what the default buys: a baseline scenario is a run executing the definition,
// so the transcripts below are read off exactly the runs the recorded traces are
// of. What each file measures still differs — a trace is the delivery, and this
// is where the definition sent it.
