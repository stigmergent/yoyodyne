// The delivery loop as a workflow definition: the sequences this build ships,
// where a project keeps its own copy of one instead, the authority they are
// compiled under, what each registered step can answer with, and the one call
// that turns a file into a graph.
//
// It is the third door onto the same steps and it opens no wider than the
// second. `actions.go` registered the pipeline's steps under selectable names;
// this selects among those names and decides where each outcome goes, which is
// the whole of what a definition can do. Nothing here decides what a step is,
// what it requires, or whether it may be performed -- the registry declares the
// first two and the grant below answers the third, and a definition that
// selected an action this build does not register, or one requiring authority
// the grant does not confer, is refused before an instance exists.
//
// Nothing in the delivery path performs anything through them. `Pipeline.Run`
// still runs the sequence Go control flow puts it in; these definitions are
// compiled and walked by the parity harness in parity_test.go, which holds them
// against the recorded baseline of what the hard-coded path actually does, and
// stepped beside every real run by the declarative path in declarative.go, whose
// doors perform nothing. Making them the thing that runs a real work item needs
// what the design calls for and none of it is here: the step-attempt record, the
// idempotency key, and the reconciliation that make an action with a side effect
// safe to re-perform after a death.
