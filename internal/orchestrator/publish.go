// The harness performs, the roles decide. The developer's phase is what causes
// a branch to be pushed and a pull request to be opened, and the reviewer's
// approving verdict is what causes it to be merged — but the harness executes
// both, and neither role is given a credential, a tool, or a request for
// either. On the reviewer's side that is a boundary rather than an arrangement:
// it runs with no tools at all, so the role whose verdict authorizes the merge
// has no way to perform one, and its verdict reaches the target branch only
// through the checks, the independence evidence, and the fast-forward rule that
// already gate integration. The developer's side is weaker and the design says
// so: it has a shell, so what keeps it from pushing is its sandbox and its
// contract rather than something enforced here.
//
// Which branch is authoritative is settled the same way. The local target
// branch is the one that moves, and the forge is then asked to merge the pull
// request that carries exactly that commit. A merge commit is what the forge
// makes of it, so the remote target ends up one commit ahead of the local one
// and identical in content: there is one promotion, one reviewed commit, and
// one answer about where a project's work is, published under a merge commit
// the forge owns. A remote that ends up carrying anything else is reported
// rather than reconciled behind the operator's back.
//
// A target branch the forge protects is the exception, and it is decided per
// promotion by asking the forge (landsThroughPullRequest). There the local
// target does not move first: the change lands only by the forge merging its
// pull request, and the local branch follows by a fast-forward onto the remote.
// A local promotion onto a protected target is one the forge may refuse or hold
// for hours, and every one of those left the primary checkout's main ahead of
// origin with nothing that reconciles the two.
