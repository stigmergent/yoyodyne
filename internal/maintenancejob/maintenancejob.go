// Package maintenancejob is the operator's hand-rolled launchd maintenance job,
// com.yoyodyne.maintenance, as the product sees it: whether it is on this
// machine, what of the product it duplicates, and retiring it.
//
// The job predates the supervisor. Every ten minutes it ran a script that
// started and restarted the scheduler, restarted the Slack sink, started the
// dashboard, ran `yoyo reconcile`, and rebuilt bin/yoyo after a landing. Once
// the supervisor manages those parts, the job manages them too for as long as
// it is loaded, and two managers of one process start, kill, and restart it
// against each other: on 2026-09-26 the job's bounce-when-idle step killed the
// watch 32 times, cancelling the pulls and recurring passes in it. Retiring it
// used to be two commands from docs/operations.md, which is a hand step, and the
// operator's rule of 2026-09-26 is that a hand step is a defect.
//
// So `yoyo doctor` reports the job as a second manager of the product's parts,
// naming what it duplicates, and the supervisor retires it as it is installed:
// the job is booted out of launchd and its property list removed, and what it
// was is recorded. The one duty of the job the product still needed —
// rebuilding bin/yoyo when the target branch lands — is the supervisor's own
// (supervise.Rebuilder), so nothing outside the product deploys over it.
//
// Only the job this user's LaunchAgents directory installed is retired. A job
// of the same label that launchd loaded from anywhere else is reported and left
// alone, because what the product removes has to be what it can name.
