// Package backlogrepair is the backlog state the records have made stale, and
// what may be corrected about it.
//
// Three things in a tracker stop describing the world without anybody having
// changed them. A status is written when work stops and is never rewritten when
// what stopped it clears, so an item whose blocking run ended reads as blocked
// forever. A dependency records that one item waits for another and goes on
// recording it after that other item closes. And an attribution stops resolving:
// an item that recorded its goal in the document's words rather than by the
// goal's identity names words nobody states once the document is reworded, an
// item that named a goal since retired or removed names a goal that is not in
// force whichever way it named it, and an item whose notes were replaced carries
// nothing at all where the tracker witnesses that it once did. Re-wording a goal
// an item named by identity is deliberately not among them — that is what the
// identity is for — so what this acts on is the attribution the goals cannot
// resolve rather than every item an amendment touched. None of the three is a
// decision anybody owes: the records already say what is true, and the tracker
// is simply still saying something else.
//
// # Nothing here decides, and nothing here acts
//
// This says what is stale and what makes it stale, from the records themselves.
// Whether to correct one is the product manager's, and correcting it is the
// harness's under the capability the product manager holds for it. What that
// separation buys is that an act can be judged twice against the same rule: once
// when a pass reports what it found, and again as the act is carried out against
// the records as they stand then rather than as the pass saw them.
//
// # A governance hold is reported and never repaired
//
// Some of this work is held for a person: an escalation waiting on a decision,
// a change that exists only on a preserved branch, a publication that never
// finished, a directive in force over the item. The first is the sharpest of
// them, because the harness's own triage blocks an item in order to escalate it
// and leaves no dependency behind — so an escalated item reads as a status with
// nothing at all standing behind it, and what stops it being cleared is the hold
// and nothing else. Such an item can look exactly as stale as any other — a blocked status
// with nothing unfinished behind it is what a preserved stoppage leaves — and
// correcting it would release work that somebody still has to decide about. So a
// held item is reported with the reason restated and is never among the repairs,
// and the reading itself decides that: holds that could not be read hold
// everything, because a reader that cannot tell a hold from a stale status must
// not clear either.
//
// The survey and the act share one classification, which is the point of their
// both asking Records.Held rather than each deciding for itself: an item the
// survey lists as held is one the act refuses, with the same reason, and an item
// the survey offers is one the act judges again against the records as they
// stand then. What that classification says about a preserved change is the read
// model's to derive — readmodel.HeldForAPerson looks for the stopped run's branch
// and worktree in the repository rather than reading the run's removal flags —
// and nothing here re-derives it. On 2026-09-19 the survey listed
// yoyodyne-ifd.372 under the state a repair corrects while the item's own notes
// said its run's branch and worktree were checked and there, and the clear that
// followed was made on that listing; the misread was in the shared
// classification, which is why the correction is there and not here.
