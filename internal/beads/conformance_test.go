// that. What it must not catch is a bd that is merely slow: the first call in a
// project starts its database engine, every check here starts its own, and the
// suite runs them in parallel beside whatever else the machine is doing. At
// ninety seconds that is what it caught -- `bd create` in
// TestParentFieldConformance ran past it under -race with two check passes on
// the machine, where the whole test takes about a minute on its own.
//
// So it is sized for the loaded machine rather than the idle one, as the

// verbatim. A goal statement can contain an =, and one stored cut short at it is
// a statement that would be put back wrong.

// the whole attribution-destruction detector rests on: the witness is kept in
// the tracker's metadata precisely because the write that destroys an
// attribution cannot reach it, and a bd version that cleared metadata alongside
