// The four lines, as they are printed.
//
// This is the one place the ratified format is written down. It is here rather
// than in the CLI because the format is the contract: the same four lines are
// printed in a terminal and said in a channel, and two renderings of one
// standing is exactly the disagreement an operator would then have to
// adjudicate.
//
// Three rules hold every line, and each of them exists because its opposite
// happened. Every line is always printed, so silence never has to be
// interpreted. A line with nothing in it says "nothing" in words, because a
// blank reads as a bug in the printing rather than as an empty state. A line
// whose source could not be read says so instead of saying "nothing", because a
// confident emptiness assembled from a file nobody could open is the worst
// answer this could give.
