// The factory as a whole having stopped: no work pulled and no recurring pass
// succeeding, for longer than the configured limit.
//
// From 21:51 PDT on 2026-09-29 to 09:48 PDT on 2026-09-30 no recurring pass
// completed, the watch pulled nothing, and no developer run succeeded. It was
// read at the time as every pass failing on a tracker listing that timed out;
// the machine was in fact asleep with its lid closed, and one pass spanning the
// sleep held the watch's poll
// (docs/diagnoses/yoyodyne-ifd-433-20-tracker-listing-timeouts.md). The roles
// that would have noticed were the ones not running, and the one trace was a
// line in the operator's maintenance log. The
// stall below is read from the run records and the sweep log alone — nothing a
// role writes, and nothing that asks the tracker — so it is still readable when
// the tracker is what stopped everything.
