// Package readmodel is the one server-side derivation the operator surfaces
// project. Nothing here renders for a particular surface and nothing here
// writes: it reads the durable records the harness already keeps and says what
// they mean, so that a number the CLI reports and the same number a channel
// reports cannot disagree.
//
// What it answers first is the standing question — where does the harness stand
// right now — in the four lines the operator ratified:
//
//	Running        the developer runs in flight, each with item, phase, elapsed, spend
//	Working        the persona conversations with a turn in flight
//	Not startable  each admitted item nothing will pull, with the refusal that stops it
//	Needs a human  what is waiting on a person, and whose move it is
//
// The lines are a contract rather than a layout. Every one of them is printed
// on every reading, because the failure they exist to end is silence: an
// operator who sees nothing cannot tell a quiet machine from a dead one, and
// four lines that are sometimes absent are four lines nobody can rely on. A
// line with nothing in it says "nothing", and a line whose source could not be
// read says that instead — never "nothing", which would be the confident
// emptiness every report in this harness is written to avoid.
//
// There is no fifth line and no residual category. Work that is admitted, has a
// free slot, and is held back by nothing is startable and is about to be
// started, so it is named in the not-startable line's own count of the backlog
// rather than in a bucket for whatever was left over: a residual category is
// where the states nobody thought about go to be invisible.
//
// # Where the answers come from
//
// Each line reads the truest record for it and nothing else. The runs come from
// durable run state, the conversations from the conversation records and the
// advisory hold that is the only thing that actually knows a turn is in flight
// — observed rather than taken, so that reading the status never costs the
// operator the conversation it describes — the refusals from the queue's own
// account of what holds each entry back, and the attention conditions from the
// switches, directives, proposals, and unsettled runs the harness records as it
// goes. Nothing is read from a session's memory of what it has already tried:
// that is a fact about one process rather than about the product, and an item
// passed over because a watch session remembers failing at it is an item this
// says nothing about.
