// What a program manager's pass opens with, and the one named query a reply may
// ask for in full.
//
// "The fixed capability set" in docs/designs/program-manager.md gives the role
// `readmodel.read`, delivered two ways. Every pass opens with the standing, the
// throughput windows, the capacity state, the docket as counts, the reports
// pile as counts, and a line per other instance; and a bounded block in a reply
// asks for one named query in full. Both are read here, from the one read model
// every operator surface projects, and from nowhere else: a program manager
// that wants what the channel said reads the record the channel was rendered
// from, never the channel.
//
// The opening is counts on purpose. It is carried on every pass, and a pass
// that wants the entries behind a count asks for the query by name.
