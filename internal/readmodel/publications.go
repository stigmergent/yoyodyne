// What is awaiting the forge, answered once.
//
// A promotion is on the local target branch the moment a run integrates it, and
// on the remote only once the forge merges the pull request that carries it. In
// between it is awaiting the forge, and so is a promotion whose merge the forge
// dropped: the change reads as landed everywhere else while the request sits on
// the forge unmerged, waiting on whoever finds out.
//
// Until yoyodyne-ifd.357 two surfaces answered "what is awaiting the forge" from
// two different readings. The channel's heartbeat counted it from the record's
// own predicate, runstate.State.AwaitingForge, and the four lines derived it from
// the runs that still owe a step — which a run settled after a dropped merge is
// not, so its unpublished promotion was in the hourly count and on no line at a
// terminal. This is the one reading both take.

// AwaitingForge is every recorded promotion whose publication the forge has not
// finished, by the record's own predicate and nothing else. It is a function
// over the states a caller has already read rather than a reading of its own,
// because the heartbeat counts it from the same reading it selects its
// crossings from, and two readings of the same files a moment apart could
// disagree about one run.

// awaitingForgeAttention is one unpublished promotion as the attention line
// carries it, with whose move it is: a merge the forge is holding is the
// forge's, a merge it dropped is the development manager's to re-arm or a
// person's to make by hand, a request nothing ever asked the forge to merge is
// the development manager's to decide — a re-arm the harness carries out, or a
// re-run — and a promotion whose record holds no request at all is the
// harness's: the next reconcile looks the request up by the run's branch and
// arms its merge. Until yoyodyne-ifd.429.31 the request nothing asked the forge
// to merge was the operator's, whose only move was a hand merge on the forge;
// an unmerged request whose record carries some other account and no drop is
// the development manager's too, handed back to her like a drop, since the
// ownership registry names the operator only where the forge refuses the
// harness's token, which no record here says. All are settled by the same sweep once the
// forge records the merge, and the sentence Attention.Whose derives from the
// record says so. A merge the sweep withdrew because its checks failed on the
// target itself is the harness's too: it waits on the items filed for that
// check, and the harness takes it up once they close (yoyodyne-m5p).

	// and the sentence says so — a placeholder belongs in the sentence, not in
	// a field a surface would act on.
