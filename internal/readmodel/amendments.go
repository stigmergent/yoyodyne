// How the queue of proposed changes stands, and which of them the owning role
// has already argued, derived once for every surface.
//
// Two things about the queue are waiting on a person and were said by nothing.
// The first is the queue itself getting old: forty-four proposals stood
// undecided against the architect's documents with the oldest weeks old, and
// the attention line named each one and folded most of them into "and 34
// things not named here", so a reader saw a list and never a queue that had
// stopped draining. The second is the owner's recommendations: a recurring pass
// puts the undecided proposals to the owning role and records what it argued,
// and that batch is the operator's to decide from — which nothing said either,
// because the sweep log is read by `yoyo sweeps` and nothing else.
//
// So both are derived here, from the amendment log and the sweep log and
// nowhere else. The count-and-age line is the sibling of the report pile's, on
// the same threshold and for the same reason; the recommendations are read
// off the recorded passes, latest first per proposal, and a proposal the
// operator has decided since is dropped from the batch wherever it is read —
// the account on the sweep record is the role's own words and is never
// rewritten, so dropping happens here rather than there.
