package modelfailover

// Failing over between providers rather than within one.
//
// The rebuild is what these are here for. A substitution that stays on the
// provider keeps the session it was already holding, so nothing about it proves
// anything about durable state; one that leaves the provider has no session to
// keep, and whether the turn carries on at all is decided entirely by what the
// harness wrote down. So these exercise the crossing rather than asserting it:
// which invoker was asked, what it was asked with, and what the record says
// afterwards.
