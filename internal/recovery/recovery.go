// Package recovery says which failures the harness waits out and asks again
// rather than records as terminal, and how long it waits between attempts.
//
// The rule it implements is the operator's, stated on 2026-09-03: the harness
// never fails outright on anything that can recover. What produced it is four
// runs killed in one day, each at its final publish or integrate step, each by a
// single connection reset the next attempt would have survived — completed and
// sometimes reviewed work recorded as failed, with the intake brake then holding
// the whole line because three runs had blocked in a row.
//
// Two things are deliberately narrow here. The failure classes are the ones
// nobody has to argue about — a reset connection, a network that went away, a
// transport that refused before anything read the request — because the full
// recoverable-versus-terminal taxonomy is the architect's and this does not wait
// on it. And there is no configuration: the intervals are the harness's and the
// same for every product, exactly as the tracker-read retry the scheduler takes
// is, because what they measure is how long a connection that comes back takes
// rather than anything about a project.
