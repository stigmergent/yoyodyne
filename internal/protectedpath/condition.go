package protectedpath

// A done-condition no developer run may satisfy.
//
// The gate in protectedpath.go refuses a developer's diff that touches an
// artifact home the item did not grant. What it cannot refuse is the item
// itself: a done-condition that names a design, a decision record, or a product
// artifact — "the design's query list marks the query as existing", "reconcile
// the design document's yoyo status entry", "her ruling is recorded on the
// design" — is a condition the run may not write the satisfaction of, and the
// run finds that out only by spending itself. Three items in one week did
// (yoyodyne-ifd.141.1, .63, and .68.25 before them): each ran, each parked or
// spent review rounds on the one clause no diff could meet, and each was fixed
// afterwards by the architect amending the document through the governed path.
// The development manager's 2026-09-03 checklist said where the fix belongs — a
// precondition or an edit the done-means implies is structure at admission, not
// a finding at review — and this is that structure.
//
// So an item's done-conditions are read where the item is written. A clause of
// the description's done-means or of the acceptance criteria that names a path
// under one of the artifact homes, or a document one of those homes owns, is
// refused unless the item grants that path — with the clause quoted and the fix
// named, which is one of two things: take the clause out and say the document's
// owner amends it, or carry the grant where one is permitted. The run's opening
// check asks the same question of the item text it is handed, so an item that
// acquired such a clause with the tracker's own command, or was admitted before
// this existed, is refused before it is claimed rather than parked after a run.
//
// # What is read, and what deliberately is not
//
// Only the done-conditions are read: the whole of the acceptance criteria, and
// in the description the sentences from a "Done means" (or "Done:", "done
// when") to the end of their paragraph. An item's prose cites these documents
// constantly — as the design the work builds against, the invariant it is held
// to, the decision that rules something out — and a citation is not a
// condition. Measured over the 596 items this repository's tracker held when
// this was written, reading every clause fires on 117 of them, a fifth of the
// backlog; reading the done-conditions as below fires on 10, one of them
// unfinished (yoyodyne-ifd.313, whose done-means records a rule "as a section
// of slack-reporting-design"), and each of the ten names a document as
// something the work leaves in a state. The one unfinished item that names a
// product path in its done-means and carries the grant for it
// (yoyodyne-ifd.262) passes.
//
// A document is named by its path, or by its id where the id is two words or
// more. A single-word id is left to the path: the brief's id is "brief", and a
// done-condition that says "the brief's acceptance criteria hold" is citing it,
// which the 17 items whose done-means say something of that kind bear out.
// An id that is also a role's name — program-manager, the design of the role
// of that name — is the role where the clause says only the name, and the
// document where it says design or document beside it or writes the file name:
// read otherwise, every item about the role was refused for naming its design.
// Documents under the invariants directory are named by path only, for the
// reason the artifact store excludes them from its identity scheme: an invariant
// is delivered to every run by its id and cited by it in nearly every item, and
// a done-condition that edited one would name its path.
//
// # Who executes the item changes the answer
//
// The question above has a second half, and it was not asked until
// yoyodyne-ifd.330 cost a run: not only which document a done-condition names,
// but who the item says carries it out. An item whose executor is a role's
// conversation is that role's work, and a done-condition naming a document the
// role owns is the condition stated correctly — "the ruling is recorded on the
// slack-reporting design" is exactly what the architect's conversation does —
// so it is admitted, and it is what the harness later reads to close the item
// when the revision lands. The same clause on an item nobody marked is refused,
// because that item is a developer run and no run can write it.
//
// And the shape itself is read, without any document named. 330 was admitted
// with "Done means the design is recorded in the governed documents" and no
// executor, and selection had nothing to go on: no document was named, the
// tracker called the item ready, and a developer run was spent finding out
// that the design had already landed. So a done-condition that says a design
// or a ruling is recorded, published, promoted, or ratified is read as the
// design owner's conversation work, and so is a title whose subject is that
// role — "The architect designs …", "The architect rules …" — because the
// architect executes nothing in a run. Measured over the 596 items this
// tracker held when this was written, the two readings together fire on 27
// items: 24 that carry the executor already, 330, and two admitted before the
// marker existed (yoyodyne-ifd.68.1 and .68.25) whose clause a run indeed
// could not meet. An item that reads so and names no executor is refused with
// the marker named as the fix.
