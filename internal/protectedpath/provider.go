package protectedpath

// The paths a grant does not reach.
//
// A grant is an exception to this package's refusal, which is the only refusal
// this package makes. It is not an exception to the provider's. Claude Code
// denies an agent's writes to its own settings files at the tool-permission
// layer, above whatever the harness permits and whatever a work item says: the
// editing tools are refused there however the run is configured, and the shell
// sandbox names the file and cannot be disabled by policy. An item that grants
// one of those paths has therefore admitted work no run it is admitted for can
// do, and the way that is discovered is a run spending its repair rounds against
// it — yoyodyne-ifd.153 spent three before anybody knew.
//
// So the set is recorded here, beside the grants it is checked against, and
// admission checks it before the work reaches the queue. Here rather than
// anywhere nearer the provider, because here is where a grant is read, and a
// boundary the harness knows about but keeps away from the grant is one every
// future admission gets to rediscover at the same price.
//
// The refusal names the provider, because what is wrong is not the item's
// judgement about the path. The change may well be the right one; it is somebody's
// to make by hand rather than a run's to be given, and an operator told only that
// a path is unreachable has nothing to act on. Whose software refuses it is the
// whole of what they can act on.

// run actually met. The list grows the same way — by something meeting the wall
// and reporting it — and a path that belongs here and is missing costs one item's
// repair budget rather than being lost, which is the right way round.
