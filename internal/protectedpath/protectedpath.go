// Package protectedpath decides which files a developer's change may touch at
// all, before anybody is asked to judge what it did to them.
//
// The documents a run derives its intent from — the project configuration, the
// product's own artifacts, the designs, and the decision records with the
// invariants extracted from them — are upstream of the change being made. A
// developer that edits one is redefining what its own work is measured against,
// and no reading of the diff tells a legitimate edit from that: both look like a
// file that changed. What does tell them apart is whether anybody decided the
// path was in scope, and that decision exists in one place already. The work
// item is written and reviewed before the run starts, so an exception stated in
// it is an exception somebody admitted, and an exception stated nowhere is one
// the developer granted itself.
//
// So these paths are default-deny for a developer's diff, and the way out is the
// work item rather than the run. What that buys is determinism at the point the
// cost is lowest: a reviewer catches this class by judgement, one Opus review at
// a time, and the same finding here costs a string comparison. The refusal names
// the grant mechanism for the same reason it exists at all — a developer that
// genuinely needs one of these paths has somewhere to raise it, and a gate with
// no stated way out is a gate agents work around.
