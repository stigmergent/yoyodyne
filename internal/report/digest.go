package report

// A program manager's digest: the one report a pass files to the Lead Product
// Manager, in a fixed shape.
//
// "What leaves the lane" in docs/designs/program-manager.md is the rule. An
// instance files nothing per finding. Everything it has to say outside its lane
// in one pass goes into one report, filed through the ordinary report block, so
// it lands in the pile the Lead Product Manager already walks and is decided
// with the "handle" action she already has. What makes it a digest rather than
// a paragraph is the shape: the lane and the pass, what the pass admitted, each
// request outside the lane with the work, the goal, the priority, and why, each
// objection to an admission with the item and the concern, and the instance's
// open requests restated by id. A slice of them then reads alike.
//
// The shape is checked where every report is checked, so a digest that does
// not hold to it is refused with the reason, as any unreadable report is. The
// lane and the pass are the harness's to stamp, never the instance's to assert,
// for the reason the rest of a report's attribution is.

// DigestContract is what a role that files a digest is told about its shape.
// It is here beside the check so the two cannot come to disagree.
const DigestContract = `# Your digest to the Lead Product Manager

Everything a pass has to say outside your lane goes to the Lead Product Manager as one digest, filed as one entry of your report block, and nothing is filed per finding. It lands in the pile she walks, and she decides it with her "handle" action. The entry takes a "digest" in place of a message, or beside one sentence that leads it:

` + "```" + `yoyodyne-report
{"reports":[{"severity":"note","digest":{"admissions":["the ids of the items this pass admitted in your lane"],"requests":[{"work":"the work you recommend outside your lane","goal":"the goal it would serve, in the words the goals state it","priority":2,"why":"why"}],"objections":[{"item":"the id of a new admission","concern":"what is wrong with it"}],"open_requests":["the ids of your requests from earlier passes that are still open"]}}]}
` + "```" + `

Leave out any list you have nothing for, and file no digest at all on a pass with nothing to say. File it at "note", or at "warning" where it carries an objection or a blocker of your own; a digest carrying an objection at "note" is refused, and a digest is never "critical" — something already costing somebody is its own report. Priority is 0 first and 4 last. Each list holds at most ` + maxDigestEntriesText + ` entries, and every id is the id alone. The harness stamps your lane and the pass, so name neither. One digest per pass: a reply carrying two, or a second in a pass that already filed one, is refused, and so is a digest that does not hold to this shape. A refused digest is not filed, the reason is written on the pass's record, and you are told why on your next turn.

The digest is read by people who do not know your lane's items by number, so say in the request and the concern what the work is, not only its id.`
