// How a pile with more in it than one turn can carry is worked through, and how
// it is described to somebody deciding whether it is draining.
//
// Bounding what one turn is shown is not optional: a pile of five hundred
// reports delivered whole is the turn, and nothing else in it would get read.
// What the bound must not do is deliver the same slice every time. Ordering the
// unhandled pile worst-first and taking the first ten is exactly that failure —
// the ten it takes are the same ten until somebody decides about one of them,
// and everything filed behind them is invisible however long it waits. That is
// how this project came to hold five hundred and sixty-four unhandled reports
// with the oldest three weeks old while every turn reported a full listing.
//
// So delivery is a walk rather than a listing. A reader carries a position
// through the pile in the order it was filed, oldest first, and each turn is
// shown what the position has not passed yet. The position advances over what
// was actually shown, so the next turn resumes rather than restarts, and the
// oldest report in the pile is the first thing offered rather than the last —
// which is what makes the oldest unhandled report's age fall instead of climb.
//
// Two things sit on top of the walk. A critical report jumps it, because
// something already costing somebody has to be read today rather than when the
// walk reaches it; and the walk starts again from the beginning of the pile once
// it has reached the end and the reader's own record of what it has been shown
// has moved on, so a report offered once and left is offered again rather than
// buried. Neither re-offers anything the reader still remembers being shown,
// which is what stops a settled pile being re-read every turn.
