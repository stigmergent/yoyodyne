package gitworktree

// Starting a fresh run from a change an earlier run of the same item left on
// its branch.
//
// A worktree is always cut from exactly the branch it will be promoted into,
// because integration insists on that equality later. So a change an earlier run
// preserved cannot be the fresh worktree's base; it is lifted into it instead,
// as the working tree's uncommitted content, before the developer is invoked.
// The fresh run's change is then whatever the developer leaves on top of it, and
// every reader of that change — the checks, the reviewer, the promotion — reads
// it base-relative against the target exactly as it reads any other run's.
//
// What is lifted is what the branch carries past where it and the target last
// agreed, so a target that has moved since the earlier run is merged with rather
// than written over. A change that no longer merges cleanly is not half-applied:
// the worktree is put back as it was cut and the conflict is the error, because a
// developer handed conflict markers it did not write would be judged on them.
