package gitworktree

// Retiring what a stopped run preserved.
//
// A run that stops leaves its branch and its worktree where they are, because
// what they hold is the evidence somebody decides against. That is the right
// default and it has no end: once the work has landed by some other route, the
// two are orphans nobody knows to look for, and the harness has never had a way
// to say so.
//
// This is that way, and it keeps every rule the cleanup beside it keeps. Nothing
// here proves an integration, so nothing here deletes anything an integration
// would have justified deleting: a worktree holding uncommitted work is kept, a
// directory the harness did not register is never touched, and a branch is
// deleted only where `RemoveMergedBranch` would delete it — its work already
// contained in the target. What is left is exactly the removal that can lose
// nothing: an empty registration whose commits, if it has any, survive on a
// branch this refused to delete.
//
// Every refusal is a kept artifact with a reason rather than a failure. A caller
// retiring what a stoppage left behind is finishing something else, and a
// worktree that has to be looked at by hand is a fact to record rather than a
// reason to fail the work that reached here.
