// A worktree is cut from a commit, so a file that is derived from a store and
// committed on a cadence of its own arrives as old as the last commit that
// carried one rather than as old as the run. The tracker's export is the file
// this matters for: a run reads it to see the work around its own, the store it
// comes from is authoritative and kept current in the primary checkout, and the
// committed copy can be many items behind. A run that reads that copy does not
// read a stale picture so much as a confidently wrong one — an item its own work
// item names is simply absent, and nothing in the file says it was ever there.
//
// So the harness gives a new worktree the primary checkout's copy, and then
// keeps that copy out of the change the run is making. Both halves are needed.
// An export left as an ordinary working-tree edit is staged by the commit every
// attempt makes, promoted into the target with the work, and conflicts against
// every other run that refreshed the same file — one derived file would turn
// parallel development into a queue of merge conflicts. Git is told to leave the
// path alone instead, which is what keeps the refreshed copy out of status, out
// of staging, and out of every diff a reviewer is shown.
//
// That bit is where the hold is kept rather than what enforces it. It lives in
// the worktree's index under `.git`, which a developer's sandbox grants writes
// to, so a run that flipped it back would hand the harness the refreshed export
// as part of its change. The change-path gate refuses a diff containing one of
// these exports for that reason — `internal/protectedpath/export.go` — and what
// the gate reads is CurrentExports below, so the paths held and the paths
// refused are one list.

// CurrentExports names the exports this manager refreshes and holds out of a
// run's change, in the form every path here is compared in.
//
// It is read by the gate in front of the checks, which refuses a change that
// contains one of them. The hold is an index bit inside `.git`, and a developer
// sandbox grants writes there, so the paths a run may not commit have to be
// known where the change is judged rather than trusted to survive whatever ran
// in the worktree. Asking the manager that holds them is what keeps the two
// lists from being two lists.
