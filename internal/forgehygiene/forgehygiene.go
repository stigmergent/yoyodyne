// Package forgehygiene is the harness's own look at the forge on the development
// manager's recurring pass: which pull requests the forge holds open for work
// that is over.
//
// A run publishes its branch as a pull request and the reviewer's verdict merges
// it, so on the ordinary path a request closes with the run that opened it. Two
// things leave one open instead. A later run for the same item lands its own
// request and closes the item, and the earlier request sits open on a branch
// nobody will merge; or the branch was brought onto its target some other way
// — a merge by hand, a replay — and the request stays open carrying nothing.
// Neither is visible from the tracker, which is what the pass read until now,
// and thirty of them accumulated before anybody looked at the forge itself.
//
// This notices and does nothing else. Each request it finds is stated as a
// finding on the pass, keyed on the request so it is said once rather than
// once an hour, and closing it is somebody's decision rather than this code's:
// a request the forge holds open is a thing a person may still want, and the
// harness's part is to make sure they know it is there.
