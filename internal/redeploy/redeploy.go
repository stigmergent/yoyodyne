// Package redeploy is how a process that outlives a deploy takes the deploy up.
//
// Everything else in the harness is a command: it starts, it acts on the binary
// it was started from, and it exits, so "which build is this running" is
// answered by whichever build the operator last typed. A watch session is not
// that. It stays open for days, and it goes on choosing and dispatching work
// from the binary it was started with while fixes land on the main line behind
// it — which is invisible from everything else the record says, because the runs
// it starts look exactly like runs started by a current one.
//
// Nothing outside the process can close that gap. Killing a session cancels the
// run it is carrying, so an external job may only bounce it while the machine is
// idle; with a deep backlog and more than one developer slot the next run starts
// the moment one settles, and a poll at any interval never lands in that window.
// The only thing standing in the gap between runs is the session itself.
//
// So this is the small half of that: which file this process was started from,
// whether that file has been replaced since, and re-executing it — or, for a
// session that still has runs to host, starting it beside this one. When the
// session takes it up is the scheduler's — between runs, never during one.
