These are the outcomes the first version is built to reach.

## Goals

- Maintain a traceable chain from the product brief through goals, designs, work, code changes, and verification.
  *Supports: every change traces to intent somebody approved.*
- Isolate implementation tasks in harness-managed Git worktrees.
  *Supports: intent goes in and merged software comes out.*

// from constants written beside this test, because a test naming the directories
// itself would be checking the set it chose rather than the set the harness
// reads, and would keep passing after the project moved them.
//
// What this refuses and what it tolerates is a decided boundary rather than an
// oversight, and yoyodyne-ifd.326 moved that line. It used to fall between a
// contradiction and an absence, which put a goals document asserting something
// the brief does not say on the refusing side. It now falls between the
// harness's own record and the product's prose: nothing a person writes in a
// goals document reddens this build, and what is held here is the identity the
// harness validates and the reports it produces about that prose.
//
// The reason is the one the reviewer gave for the states that were already
// tolerated, followed the rest of the way. A `*Supports: ...*` trailer stops
// naming a brief goal the moment somebody rewords that claim in the brief, and
// both documents are the product manager's to write; a build that goes red on
// the edit makes rewording the document to suit the checker the cheapest way out,
// which is exactly the pressure the tolerated states exist to avoid. So the
// check moved to the surfaces that can afford to be right about it — `yoyo goals
// list` names it on stderr and in `--json`, and `internal/conformance`'s goals
// check carries it into a release assessment, where a goals document nobody can
// read refuses the cut and a broken link upstream is a note beside it.
//
// Refused, because each is the harness's own record wrong rather than a
// document part-way written:
//
//   - The store failing to load, a recorded document it could not read, a
//     `supports:` naming an artifact nobody records, a revision under no
//     authority. TestThisRepositoryOwnArtifactsAreReadableByTheHarness refuses
//     these one layer up for the same reason, and the reason is written down
//     there: the harness reports them and refuses nothing over one, so a warning
//     nobody is made to read is how one of them breaks unnoticed. They are
//     identity and authority the harness validates rather than anything the
//     product manager writes in prose.
//
//   - A report of any of the tolerated states below that names no file to open,
//     and a recorded brief the collected goals do not say where to find. A
//     legitimate state described by a report nobody can act on is ours to fix
//     rather than the product manager's, and it is the whole of what is left
//     here about the live documents.
//
// Tolerated, because each is the product's own prose rather than the harness
// contradicting itself, and each is already reported by `yoyo goals list` on
// stderr and carried into `yoyo release`'s goals check:
//
//   - A goals document stating no goals, and no goal in force at all. A goals
//     set is legitimately empty before the goals are written, and Collect
//     reporting it is the correct report rather than a defect.
//
//   - A goal naming nothing upstream. The goal has yet to say what it is for,
//     which is a sentence somebody still has to write and not a false one.
