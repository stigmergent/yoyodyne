// Package goal is the goals a repository records, read as the things work can
// be attributed to rather than as prose somebody checks by hand.
//
// Identity gave the goals document a name; it did not make the goal written on
// a work item mean anything. That goal is free text, and free text always
// resolves: an item attributed to a goal nobody wrote, to a goal whose wording
// moved on, and to a sentence that merely reads like one are indistinguishable
// from an item that serves an approved goal. It is the last link of the chain
// from the brief to the code, and it is the one that decides whether moving
// approval up from each item to the goals removes the gate or moves it.
//
// So a goal is read out of the goals artifacts themselves: each statement under
// a goals document's `Goals` heading is a goal that can be named, and resolving
// an attribution is finding the artifact that states it.
//
// # What an attribution matches on
//
// A goal carries a stable identifier, written in square brackets at the start of
// its entry, and that identifier is what an attribution resolves by. It is
// assigned once and never reused, and it survives every re-wording of the goal:
// the words are what a person reads and what a work item displays, and they are
// not what the match depends on.
//
// The match was on the words until yoyodyne-ifd.344, because the words were all
// the document offered, and three amendments in three weeks showed what that
// costs. Re-wording a goal orphaned every item attributed to it and refused
// every admission quoting it — silently, until four admissions failed at intake
// and the operator learned of it by watching them fail. An offer to re-attribute
// at amendment time would have been a patch on a design that treats prose as a
// key; an identifier makes the class impossible, and reduces amending a goal to
// editing a sentence rather than renaming a thing.
//
// The words still resolve, for a goal that carries no identifier yet and for an
// attribution recorded before identifiers existed. Case, spacing, and trailing
// punctuation are folded there, because those differences are not disagreements
// about which goal is meant, and nothing else is guessed at: an attribution no
// document states is unresolved rather than approximately right. What that path
// does not survive is the re-wording, which is why `yoyo goals reattribute`
// exists to move an attribution off it.
//
// A goal therefore carries the operator's approval of the document stating it,
// because that is now what the gate rests on: work is admitted to the queue
// without a person on the strength of serving an approved goal, so resolving an
// attribution and knowing whether anybody agreed to what it resolved to are the
// same question asked once. ApprovalGap is where that question is answered.
//
// # What is done about each state, and why
//
// An attribution is checked where it is made, which is where work is admitted.
// Admitting work under a goal nothing states is refused there, because that is
// the one moment when refusing costs nothing: the item does not exist yet.
//
// Work admitted before any of this existed is grandfathered, deliberately and
// not by omission. It is reported as unattributed wherever the queue is read,
// it can acquire an attribution without anything already written being
// rewritten, and nothing refuses to run it. The alternative rules were both
// worse: a rule that failed every item admitted before attributions were
// checked would stop all work to close a gap that has cost nothing yet, and a
// backfill the harness performed itself would be the harness deciding what
// somebody else's work is for, which is the product manager's judgement and not
// a derivation.
//
// That is why an item with no attribution and an item whose attribution
// resolves to nothing are different states here rather than one "not
// traceable". The first is work that predates the rule and is somebody's to
// attribute; the second is a claim that is wrong, on an item that asserted
// something the goals do not say.
//
// # An attribution that was there and is not
//
// A third way to record no goal is to have recorded one and lost it. The
// attribution lives in the item's notes, and a writer that replaces those notes
// rather than appending to them takes the goal with them — which has happened
// twice, to six items at once and then to twelve more, and read afterwards
// exactly like work admitted before goals were checked. Grandfathering is what
// made it silent: the state it decayed into is the one state deliberately
// reported without failing.
//
// So an attribution the harness writes is witnessed outside the notes, and this
// package is told what that witness holds. Notes recording no goal on an item
// the tracker witnesses one was written on is not a gap somebody has yet to
// fill; it is a record that was destroyed, and it is reported as its own state
// and failed rather than grandfathered.
//
// The witness carries the goal it saw written, so putting a destroyed
// attribution back is reading the record rather than judging the work again.
// What it must never do is answer for the item: the state above is decided from
// the notes alone, because an attribution the notes lost and the metadata
// answered for would report as intact while the item stayed empty — the silence
// this exists to end, arrived at from the other side.
