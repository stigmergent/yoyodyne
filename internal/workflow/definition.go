// Package workflow is the declarative form of a sequence the harness executes:
// the states it can be in, the registered action each one performs, and where
// each outcome of that action goes next.
//
// It is a state machine rather than a list of steps, because the sequences this
// harness actually runs branch — a review that asks for changes goes back to the
// developer, a promotion that lost a race goes back to the same place — and a
// list cannot say that. It is deliberately not a language: there are no
// expressions, no conditions of its own, and no way to describe an action. A
// definition selects among actions Go registered and decides what happens after
// each outcome, which is the whole of what it can do. That is the same sentence
// `internal/action` enforces from the other side, and it is why a definition is
// safe to read from a project's own repository.
//
// This package gives a definition a shape, a stable serialized form, a content
// digest an instance can pin itself to, a validation that either produces a
// definition every later reader can trust or refuses the whole of it, a loader
// that compiles what passed into a graph — every state resolved to the action
// code registered, every transition resolved to a destination that exists, and
// the whole of it held against the authority it was compiled under and the digest
// it was pinned to — and an executor that walks such a graph one durable
// transition at a time, recording every state boundary it crosses so a process
// killed at one is resumed exactly there.
//
// What an instance durably is lives in `internal/runstate`, beside every other
// record the harness keeps: this package decides what a transition is and when
// one has happened, and the state store is what writes it down.
//
// Nothing in the delivery path runs on it. The executor is exercised against test
// graphs, because what makes an action with a side effect safe to re-perform
// after a death — the step-attempt record, the idempotency key, and the
// reconciliation the design describes — is a later milestone, and the pipeline
// still runs the sequence Go control flow puts it in.
