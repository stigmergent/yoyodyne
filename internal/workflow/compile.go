// capability". Validation answers whether a definition selects actions that
// exist at all; a grant answers whether the thing about to run it may perform
// them. The two are apart because one definition is valid wherever it is read and
// is still compiled under whatever authority the caller holds — the same file
// bound to something that may only read is a refusal, and it is a refusal before
// an instance exists rather than at the step that would have promoted something.

// costs nothing.

// all. A grant answers whether the thing running this may perform what it
// selected; separation answers whether the sequence it selected keeps authorship
