	KindWatchReadRetrying Kind = ownership.NotificationWatchReadRetrying

	KindLineWaiting Kind = ownership.NotificationLineWaiting
	// A session that is choosing work while running a binary the harness has moved
	// on from. Like the line above it this is a state said again while it stands
	// rather than a transition, and for a sharper reason: nothing in the record
	// says it at all. A stale session goes on pulling work and the runs it starts
	// go on looking ordinary, so the only visible symptom is rounds spent against
	// bugs that were fixed on the main line hours earlier — which reads as an agent
	// failing rather than as a process nobody restarted.
	KindResidentStale Kind = ownership.NotificationResidentStale
	// The harness having started nothing at all while work was ready to start.
	// It is the opposite reading from the line above it: that one is derived from
	// a record something wrote about itself, and this one from the absence of any
	// such record — nothing has started since a moment the runs themselves date,
	// and nothing accounts for it. That is why it exists separately. A scheduler
	// that crashes writes no stop and a wedged one goes on claiming to watch, so
	// the state where everything has quietly gone dead is precisely the state no
	// process is left to announce; on 2026-09-01 it ran seven and a half hours and
	// was found by a person rather than by anything here.
	//
	// It is said again while it stands, and louder as it ages. It used to be said
	// once, on the reasoning that a stopped machine is either acted on or it is
	// not; on 2026-09-07 it was not, and four stopped hours had produced one
	// message four hours old. A line that is completely stopped is the most
	// serious thing this vocabulary carries, so the sink repeats it on its
	// heartbeat, raises it to critical as it stands, and tags the operators each
	// time. How often and how loud are the sink's; this is what is said.
	KindStallNoticed Kind = ownership.NotificationStallNoticed
	// The harness waiting out the provider's usage window. It is the same silence
	// the stall above reports and the opposite fact about it: nothing has started,

	// said because the silence itself is not readable — on 2026-09-05 a session
	// waited a window out from 12:13Z to 13:43Z, the stall alarm fired over it
	// saying nothing accounted for it, and the operator was paged for a machine
	// doing exactly what the provider had told it to.
	//
	// It is a note and never a warning, and it is said once per window rather than
	// again while it stands. Nothing is degraded and nothing is waiting on
	// anybody, so a second message would be a reason to mute the channel that
	// carries the alarm this replaces.
	KindProviderWindow Kind = ownership.NotificationProviderWindow
	// The provider holding every configured role at once. It is the capacity half
	// of the stall: the window above is a session waiting out a window it met
	// itself, and this is every role refused on a known reset with nothing
	// configured to fail over to — which the session choosing work never records,
	// because it is not the thing being refused. Between 2026-09-08 and 09-13 the
	// harness wrote 134 refusals down, each said once in the channel, and the fact
	// they added up to reached the operator five days later from his assistant.
	//
	// It is a warning, said the first time it is seen and again while it stands,
	// and it goes to the operators directly rather than to the channel alone: a
	// line stopped on a known reset with a remedy in the configuration is the
	// sharpest case there is of the harness being degraded by something a person
	// can change.
	KindCapacityHold Kind = ownership.NotificationCapacityHold
	// The provider answering nobody: a login nobody has renewed, or an API nothing
	// reaches. It is the other half of the capacity hold — no reset, no window,
	// nothing the harness can wait out on a clock — and the one the operator has
	// to be told the moment it happens, because a person is the only thing that
	// ends the first kind and the record is the only thing that says either.
	// From 2026-09-17 18:17 local every dispatch was refused, every recurring
	// pass recorded 0 turns, and the brake tripped naming the wrong remedy; the
	// operator learned of it by asking, three days later.
	//
	// It is a warning, said once when it is seen and tagged to the operators by
	// member id, because it is both important and theirs to act on. It is not
	// said again while it stands: the line's own banner carries it, and what a
	// repeated message would buy is a reason to mute the channel.
	KindProviderOutage Kind = ownership.NotificationProviderOutage
	// The provider answering again after an outage: the login was renewed, or the
	// network came back. It is said once, as a note, because the operator was told

	// remedy is the harness's own: nothing was released and nothing was restarted.
	KindProviderRestored Kind = ownership.NotificationProviderRestored
	// A recurring task whose firings keep failing before their first turn: the
	// harness refusing the message it composed for the pass, a conversation
	// nothing can open, a turn that will not assemble. From 06:39Z on 2026-09-26
	// every development manager sweep failed that way six times in a row, every
	// triage decision waited a day, and the only account was a line per firing
	// in the sweep log. It does not end by waiting — the next firing meets the
	// same refusal — so it is said from the second failure in a row, once as a
	// warning and once more as critical once it has stood two hours, and not
	// again: the attention line carries it while it stands, and the first firing
	// that takes a turn ends it.
	KindRecurringTaskFailing Kind = ownership.NotificationRecurringTaskFailing
	// A claim the harness gave back because nothing was working on it. It is the
	// same reading as the stall above, taken from the other end: that one asks
	// whether anything has started and this one asks whether what the tracker says
	// is running actually is. The difference is what each can see. An item the
	// harness claimed has left the ready queue, so a machine whose only startable
	// work is sitting under dead claims reads as a drained queue — nothing held,
	// nothing running, nothing ready — and the stall reading is silent about it by
	// construction. Four nights of throughput went that way in the week of
	// 2026-09-01.
	//
	// It is said once per release, which is once per stuck item, because the
	// release is what ends the state: what follows it is the item being pulled

	KindClaimReleased Kind = ownership.NotificationClaimReleased
	// One value the project's template has improved that this project has never
	// edited. It is the third state here rather than a crossing, and it is the
	// mildest thing this vocabulary carries: nothing is wrong, nothing is waiting,
	// and nothing changes until somebody adopts it. What it is for is the project
	// that materialized from a template and then never heard that the template
	// moved — every surface that could have told them is one somebody has to run,
	// and a fix to a persona nobody knows about is a fix nobody has.
	//

	// of what admits it to a message somebody is sent rather than one they come
	// looking for: a fact that repeats is a fact somebody mutes.
	KindBundleImprovement Kind = ownership.NotificationBundleImprovement
	// Several such values found on one reading, said together: how many there
	// are and the first few by name. It is the same fact as the kind above at a
	// coarser grain, and it exists because the class is bounded to one message a
	// pass: a project several template revisions behind offers a dozen values on
	// the first reading, and a dozen direct messages is the wall the
	// communication rule is against, aimed at the one channel that reaches a
