// What the thread says about a round the environment refused.
//
// The blocker a thread carries is the only account of a stoppage most people
// read, and the words around it decide what they take from the counters. A round
// the environment refused cost the item nothing, so a thread saying only what
// went wrong reads as an item one step nearer its cap when it is not. And the one
// state where that reading is correct — a return the settle decided on and could
// not write — is the one the thread has to say loudest, because the counters
// really are higher than the round cost.
