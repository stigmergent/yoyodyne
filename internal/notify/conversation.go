// What a conversation did to the backlog, read from the log it wrote while

//
// Runs are the first producer of reportable events; conversations are the
// second, and they arrive the way the design said a producer would — a selection
// function here, and nothing whatever in the sink, the threading, or the
// envelope. The shape is the same as a run's: a durable record written by a
// process that is long gone, read afterwards by something that decides nothing
// about it.
//
// What is worth saying about a conversation is not what was said in it. Most of
// a conversation's log is the turn itself — the provider's messages, the tools
// it asked for, the reply as it was written — and none of that is a milestone.
// What is a milestone is the queue moving: work admitted, work decomposed, a
// goal recorded on an item, an item's place in the order changed, and what the
// operator decided about work an agent proposed. Those are the harness's
// steering wheel turning, and an operator who cannot see them is watching a
// factory whose direction changes silently.

// The rest of the vocabulary is deliberately absent. Reading an item and

// the work started, and the close is the only sign it finished. For that item the

// nothing for the rest of the item's life.
