# yoyodyne-ifd.362: how a test that was red on the forge landed locally eight times

On 2026-09-13 the operator's assistant found that every pull request opened
since 2026-09-07 — #487 through #495 — had sat on the forge with the required
`build` check failing, that local `main` had integrated a dozen landings
meanwhile, and that `origin/main` had not moved for six days. The failing test
was yoyodyne-ifd.347's `TestAnInvocationIsMadeUnderTheAccountItWasGiven` in
`internal/backend/codex`, which asserted a `GOCACHE` redirect while handing the
backend a working directory in no repository; PR #497 fixed the test and
auto-merged the held landings.

The question, his: `make test` is a configured check. How did 347 integrate
locally with a test that fails under it — did the check not run on that
branch, or was its verdict not what gated integration? And why did six days of
a forge-wide required-check failure produce no message anywhere?

**The check ran, exited 0, and its verdict is what gated integration — on every
one of the landings.** The test was not red under `make test` as the harness
runs it. It was red only where the test binary's own environment carried no
`GOCACHE`, which is the forge and nowhere the harness ever ran it. Neither of
the two hypotheses holds; what the record shows is a third thing, and it is
below. The silence has a separate cause, also below.

## The check phase ran and passed, every time

Every developer run's event log carries the harness's own check phase as
`command.started` / `command.completed` events from source `harness.checks`,
with the command, its exit code and its verdict. For run-5f8eb416 (ifd.347,
PR #487):

| sequence | at (UTC, 2026-09-07) | command | exit | passed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 584–585 | 20:11:11 | `make fmtcheck` | 0 | true |
| 586–653 | 20:11:11 → 20:13:45 | `make test` | 0 | true |
| 654–721 | 20:13:45 → 20:16:34 | `make race` | 0 | true |
| 722–724 | 20:16:34 → 20:16:35 | `make vet` | 0 | true |

The workflow instance for the same run records the same thing at the topology
level: `check` entered at 20:11:11 with outcome `produced`, `review` entered at
20:16:35 with outcome `passed`, `integrate` at 20:20:28 on `approved`. The
`make test` output retained in the event log lists every package `ok`, with
`internal/backend/codex` reported `(cached)` — a cached *pass*, from the
developer's own probe minutes earlier in the same worktree.

The same is true of every landing that carried the red test. Reading the check
verdicts off every run record integrated between 347 and the fix:

| run | item | PR | `make test` in the check phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| run-5f8eb416 | ifd.347 | #487 | exit 0, passed, 2026-09-07 20:13 |
| run-a738aca4 | ifd.350 | #489 | exit 0, passed (twice — one repair round), 2026-09-07 23:12 |
| run-fab4da66 | ifd.351 | #490 | exit 0, passed, 2026-09-07 23:42 |
| run-8094605a | ifd.345 | #491 | exit 0, passed, 2026-09-08 00:24 |
| run-e2519421 | ifd.343 | #492 | exit 0, passed (three rounds), 2026-09-08 01:53 |
| run-ec760358 | ifd.342 | #493 | exit 0, passed, 2026-09-08 02:22 |
| run-53606c51 | ifd.285 | #494 | exit 0, passed, 2026-09-08 02:43 |
| run-7ac372e1 | ifd.356 | #495 | exit 0, passed, 2026-09-13 16:56 |

The item's account says four later landings; the record says seven, so eight
queued merges were held in all. (PR #488 belongs to run-d02b509c, ifd.346,
which failed without promoting anything and so had no queued merge.) None of
the eight carried an exit code other than 0 from `make test` in the round that
reached integration. The "dozen landings" in the assistant's account is the
commit count rather than the landing count: between #484's merge and the fix,
local `main` gained twelve commits — eleven harness commits across these eight
runs, since ifd.343 carried three attempt commits and ifd.350 two, and one
commit made by hand (`bdc2f90`, enabling the product manager's sweep). Every
run that promoted onto local `main` in the window is one of the eight, and every
one of the eight had a queued merge.

The gate itself is also seen refusing in the same window, which rules out a
gate that passes everything: run-d9b807a8 (ifd.336, 2026-09-07 08:06) has
`make test` at exit 2, `passed: false`, followed by a repair round and a green
rerun before review; run-07e4eeaa (ifd.209.29, 2026-09-13 17:59) the same. A
red `make test` is handed back to the developer, exactly as `delivery.yaml`'s
`check` state says.

## Why the test was green here and red there

The test built a Codex backend, ran it with `WorkingDirectory: "/worktree"` — a
path in no repository — and asserted that the invocation's environment carried
`GOCACHE`. The backend's environment is `os.Environ()` plus the provider home,
passed through `execution.WithGoBuildCache`, which redirects `GOCACHE` into the
repository's Git directory *only when the working directory is in a
repository*. For `/worktree` it is not, so the redirect correctly leaves the
environment alone, and the assertion reduces to: **does the test process's own
environment carry `GOCACHE`?**

In every place the harness runs the checks, it does. `internal/checks/runner.go`
runs each check with `execution.WithGoBuildCache(nil, directory)`, which sets
`GOCACHE=<repository .git>/yoyodyne/go-build` in the check's environment so
that `go test` can write its build cache inside a sandbox that grants nothing
under the user's home. `go test` hands that environment to the test binary,
`os.Environ()` in the test contains `GOCACHE`, and `hasEnvironmentName(env,
"GOCACHE")` is true. The developer's own probe gets the same redirect from the
Claude Code backend for the same reason, and passes for the same reason. On
the forge, CI sets no `GOCACHE`, the test binary's environment carries none,
and the assertion fails.

This was reproduced for this diagnosis in the developer's worktree, against
the tree as it stood before the fix (commit 716adfa, exported with
`git archive` into the run's scratch directory):

```
$ go test ./internal/backend/codex -run TestAnInvocationIsMadeUnderTheAccountItWasGiven -count=1
ok      github.com/mason-bryant/yoyodyne/internal/backend/codex 0.436s

$ go test ./internal/backend/codex -run TestAnInvocationIsMadeUnderTheAccountItWasGiven -count=1 -exec 'env -u GOCACHE'
--- FAIL: TestAnInvocationIsMadeUnderTheAccountItWasGiven (0.00s)
    --- FAIL: TestAnInvocationIsMadeUnderTheAccountItWasGiven/the_request's_account (0.00s)
        backend_test.go:462: the invocation carried no build cache the run may write: [...]
FAIL
```

The only difference between the two commands is whether the test binary
inherits `GOCACHE`. That is the whole of the discrepancy: a test whose verdict
depended on its environment, run by a harness whose environment happened to
satisfy it and a forge whose environment did not.

So the answer to the operator's question is neither of the two he offered. The
check ran on every branch, its verdict was exactly what gated integration, and
the verdict was honestly green in the environment the harness ran it in. What
was wrong was the test, and PR #497's fix — hand the backend a real temporary
worktree, so the redirect applies and the assertion tests the redirect rather
than the environment — is the right one. The reviewer that approved 347 was
told the checks had passed, which was true.

## What this changes in the integration path

The check gate was never bypassed, and nothing here says it could have been:
`repairLoop` orders the checks in front of the reviewer and the reviewer in
front of `integrate`, and `runstate.State.Validate` already refuses to store a
promotion beside a recorded failing check. But that ordering is a property of
one caller. The invariant this bears on —
`integration-requires-revision-bound-evidence` — asks for the promotion to
verify typed evidence bound to the exact candidate, whatever route reached it,
and until this change there was no such evidence on the record: a passing check
phase left nothing behind but the absence of a `check_failure`, and
`candidate.integrate` is a registered door a definition can name.

So the check phase now writes `checks_passed` onto the run — the commands that
passed, the content of the change they passed over, the attempt, and the
harness commit the worktree stood at — and `integrate` reads it before it takes
the promotion lease or writes a phase. It refuses, with `ErrIntegrationUnearned`,
when the record carries a standing check failure or protected-path refusal, no
passing checks at all, passing checks for a different attempt or a different
commit, no approving verdict, or passing checks over content other than what
the worktree holds at the moment of promotion. Recording a failure clears the
evidence; a new attempt invalidates it by moving the attempt count; an edit to
the tree invalidates it by moving the content.

The content is the binding that holds whatever else the record says. Every
developer invocation is now committed as it ends, publishing or not, so the
evidence names that commit too; but a commit says what the branch points at,
and the promotion moves the worktree's tree. `gitworktree.Manager.ContentIdentity`
names the change as the worktree holds it — a digest over the base, every path
the change touches, and the blob each one's content is, read without writing
anything — and the promotion reads it again and holds it against the record,
so an edit made after the checks and before the promotion is refused even where
nothing committed it. A reading that fails after a green suite ends the check
phase as a harness problem (`verification infrastructure failed`), not as a
verdict on the change.
`TestPerformingIntegrateRefusesAChangeTheRecordDoesNotShowPassedItsGate`
drives the registered door through each refusal and through the one record
that passes, and `TestPipelineSkipsReviewAndIntegrationWhenChecksFail` still
holds the ordinary path: a red check reaches neither the reviewer nor the
target branch.

What this does not close, and could not: a check that is green in the harness's
environment and red in the forge's. The harness's `GOCACHE` redirect is what
lets `go test` run inside a sandbox at all, and it is visible to every test
binary. A test that asserts on its own environment will pass here and may fail
there, and the only thing that catches that is the forge's required check —
which is the second half.

## Why six days of a forge-wide required-check failure said nothing

Each of the eight runs finished with its merge queued on the forge: the run
promoted the change onto local `main`, asked the forge to merge the pull
request once the base branch's requirements were met, recorded
`merge_queued: true`, and ended. From then on the run was `Outstanding()` and
every reconcile sweep took it up through `settleQueuedMerge`, which asked the
forge one question — `gh pr list --json number,url,state,mergedAt,autoMergeRequest`
— and got the same answer every time: open, unmerged, auto-merge armed.

That answer is indistinguishable from the answer a request gives in the minute
before the forge merges it. `settleQueuedMerge` therefore returned
`ActionQueued` with "the forge still has the merge of pull request N into main
queued", changed no record, and the next sweep asked again. Nothing crossed on
any run's record, so the Slack sink had nothing to say in any thread; the
heartbeat, which counts `AwaitingForge()` runs, said "N promotions awaiting the
forge" with N climbing from one to eight, which is a count and not a cause.
`yoyo reconcile` printed one "queued" line per run per sweep, which is a
standing list nobody reads. The required check's verdict was on the forge the
whole time, and nothing the harness asked the forge included it.

The records confirm the shape. All eight runs carry `updated_at` stamps on
2026-09-13 between 17:56 and 18:13 — the sweeps that settled them after #497
merged — and nothing between their completion and then: no sweep in the six
days found anything to write.

The forge's check state is now read beside the merge flag, by
yoyodyne-ifd.429.16, which landed while this item was waiting to integrate and
covers the case this item asked for. Every sweep that finds a merge still
queued asks the forge for the head's checks (`settleStillQueued` in
`internal/orchestrator/queuedchecks.go`), writes the reading onto the run's
`pull_request.checks`, and decides on it: a head behind its target failing a
check on files its change does not touch is withdrawn and replayed onto the
target; anything else red is withdrawn and handed back with the check named, as
a dropped merge. A drop reaches the channel as `merge.dropped` at warning, and
the item is blocked with the check in its blocker.

September's shape falls in the handed-back half on every one of the eight.
#487 carried ifd.347's own change, which touched the failing test, so its
reading fails on its own change. The seven after it carried the test only
because local `main` did, and each head was level with `origin/main` — nothing
had merged there for it to fall behind — so a failure on a file the change never
touched, with nothing to bring up to date, is handed back as needing a person.
Under the sweep as it now stands, the first pass after #487 was queued would
have withdrawn it and put `build` in front of the operator, and each later
landing would have done the same on its own first sweep, rather than six days of
a climbing count. `TestAQueuedHeadFailingACheckOnItsOwnChangeIsHandedBack` holds
the first case, and
`TestAQueuedHeadLevelWithItsTargetFailingAnUnrelatedCheckIsHandedBackOnTheFirstSweep`,
added here, holds the second.

This change therefore adds nothing to the sweep. An earlier revision of it read
the same state through its own field (`failing_checks`) and its own
notification (`merge.held`), which left queued merges queued and reported them;
it was dropped in favour of 429.16's reading when the two met, so the record
carries one account of a queued merge's checks rather than two.

## What this leaves

- A batch of queued merges settled *after* they all landed left every one of
  them with a publish failure. Once #497 merged the eight held requests, the
  sweep found each merged and then `ConfirmRemoteTarget` failed on all eight —
  "main on origin is at ac05c63, which carries content the promoted commit does
  not" — because that check then required the remote target's tree to equal
  the promoted commit's, which is true only for the request that merged last.
  yoyodyne-ifd.357 closed that: confirmation now asks whether the remote
  contains the promotion, and every sweep re-asks about each unfinished
  publication and finishes the ones the remote now confirms.
- Nothing groups the drops by check. Eight requests held on one `build`
  failure now say eight `merge.dropped` warnings, each naming `build`, rather
  than one line saying one check holds eight merges. That is louder than it
  needs to be and not silent, which is what this item was about.
